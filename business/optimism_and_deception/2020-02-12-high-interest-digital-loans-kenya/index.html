<p>Empowering female entrepreneurs around the world - Mexico, Philippines, India &amp; Kenya.</p>
<p>69% of global adult population is not covered by credit bureaus. Using non-traditional data, more people can get scored.</p>
<p>Credit brings opportunity and choice. We help people be in control of their finances.</p>
<h2 id="the-situation-on-the-ground">The Situation on the Ground</h2>
<p>Tala generates credit ratings from phone data: text messages, location data, contacts, and call logs.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Some messages are extremely valuable, e.g. M-Pesa receipts.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The market is unregulated. Tala&rsquo;s interest rates are ~180% annualized.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>â€‹It&rsquo;s just so convenient to take a loan from an app, as opposed to the DD required when visiting a bank.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Kenya in 2018, only 8.8% of loans were traditional. 91.2% were digital.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I think this number is inflated. Turns out that banks have also released their own apps, so it&rsquo;s not as if outside apps have dominated the market.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tala&rsquo;s debt collectors have pressure to meet targets. Thus come the threats of humiliation and manipulation of naive borrowers.</p>
<p>Traditional microfinance, as introduced by Muhammad Yunus&rsquo;s Grameen Bank, targeted small groups of women and used peer pressure to encourage repayment. But it didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>

<p>Intermediary lending orgs must monitor fund usage by partners. They must disavow predatory lending practices. They must explore debt-free alternatives.</p>
<p>Economic development efforts such as microfinance can only be successful if they&rsquo;re alongside community development. [Siroya&rsquo;s first company required entrepreneurs to reinvest in community infrastructure.]</p>
<h2 id="siroya-takes-on-the-world">Siroya Takes on the World</h2>
<p>Donors were too labor-intensive to find. InVenture was incorporated as a for-profit company. Users would text their income and expenses, InVenture would score them and license this score to banks. Banks weren&rsquo;t that interested.</p>
<p>She pivoted to lending directly - starting with Kenya. Under analysts&rsquo; pressure, they charged 15% fee for a 21-day loan (180% annualized).</p>
<p>Borrowers that are late are charged a one-time late fee and barred from taking out another loan.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>At least this is a good practice. It might be that additional interest only churns customers while a one-time late fee encourages repeated borrows. But let&rsquo;s assume Tala (and Siroya) has a good heart.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But many borrowers in Kenya took out new loans as soon as they paid off one. Some borrowers spent money on sports-gambling apps. But why would Tala choose slow its growth?</p>
<h2 id="the-math">The Math</h2>
<p>If only \(75%\) of people pay you back, how much interest do you need to charge?</p>
<p>$$ 0.75 * (1 + r) \ge 1 $$
$$ (1 + r) \ge \frac{4}{3} $$
$$ r \ge 33 \frac{1}{3}% $$</p>
<p>If the rate is actuarily fair and is conveyed clearly to borrowers, then is there a moral issue? If your math says lots of people will default and you choose to go ahead anyway, what does that make you?</p>
