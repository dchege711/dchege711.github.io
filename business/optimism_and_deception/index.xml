      <description>Motivated by the markup done by LensCrafters  
  Terms like &amp;ldquo;medical-grade&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;military-grade&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; often make consumers over-estimate the products&#39; good qualities. Sometimes the test itself is too easy to pass.
For instance, &amp;ldquo;military-grade&amp;rdquo; comes from specs by the military to enable interchangeability between manufacturers. Saying something is military-grade without quoting some mil-spec, e.g. shock tests, is bogus.  
Costco Kirkland is more likely to be high quality because Costco demands it from the supplier.</description>

      <description>Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&amp;rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&amp;rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy. 
Slots are increasingly designed for addiction, e.g. quick simple games, adding &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo;, more ways to win (and therefore more &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo; if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t bet on the additional ways), losses disguised as wins, random but weighted outcomes.</description>

BOGO goods are usually low-demand, non-efficient, lacking in quality and/or close to the expiration date. The BOGO deal is usually a 50% discount off of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). And oftentimes, this price is artificially marked up to begin with.
