Preferred &ldquo;first to market / build a unicorn&rdquo; to &ldquo;the pioneers get all the
arrows&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2021-07-14></a></span></p><p><a href=https://gosu-lang.github.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>GOSU Programming Language
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>. Founder encouraged by
the JVM language boom, but admits to underestimating the effect of dedicated
evangelists in popularizing a new programming language. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2021-07-14></a></span></p><p>Project management software for labs w/ interoperability between competing file
formats. Founder&rsquo;s professors loved it, but no one ended up paying. Founder
vowed to release early and release often. Also, researchers tend not to have
significant influence on IT budgets. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2021-07-14></a></span></p><p>Balance between &ldquo;sticking with it&rdquo; and knowing when to wrap things up. One
user&rsquo;s test is if in 3 years, the project breaks even, or has interested
investors / buyers. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2021-07-14></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>A &ldquo;stick with it&rdquo; proponent cites <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Kipling1895></a></span>&rsquo;s &ldquo;If&rdquo;. The poem has
memorable lines, e.g.</p><blockquote><p>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master</p><p>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim</p></blockquote></div></div><p>Patreon competitor whose distinguishing features depended on Instagram and
Twitter APIs. Founder&rsquo;s takeaway was being ware of social network APIs. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2021-07-14></a></span></p><p>Buttplug shaped like GW Bush. Underestimated manufacturing cost. Sold 100.
Founder thinks price point was too high for a novelty gift, and the nose was too
pointy. HN user notes booming Trump-plugs sales in Provincetown, MA. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p>Tinder-like app that auto-matches users by their FB interests. FB revoked API
keys citing violation of ToS. FB later announced their own [similar] matchmaking
service. Maybe the only way to win at an &ldquo;extra feature of an existing behemoth&rdquo;
is something that provides marginal revenue that&rsquo;s too low for the giant to
reimplement, and high enough to be beneficial to the founder. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p><a href=https://github.com/RangelReale/htmlbutcher target=_blank rel=noopener>RangelReale/htmlbutcher: HTMLButcher is an advanced HTML slicing
tool
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>. Desktop app to splice
PSD/image website designs into table-based HTML. However, the tide was changing
and people started building semantic websites with CSS and abandoned table-based
designs. Founder learned a ton of C++ though that helped him in a subsequent
digital signage app. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p>Single player word game for Android (early years of Android, so easy to get
noticed). Did not monetize enough during heyday (stuck with free ad-supported
version). Stuck in perfectionism and decision paralysis trying to please
everyone. Founder rebooting it here:

want, and then collect majority of profits. The project was too big for a solo
founder. Co-founder was coasting along, and there was no founder agreement to
lay grounds for cutting ties (dead weight scares investors and potential
teammates). In desperation, founder started working with a partner who had
undisclosed mental issues that sabotaged meetings with investors, advisors and
potential hires. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p><a href=https://nn-512.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>NN-512
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>: generate standalone C code for AVX-512 neural
nets. Expected companies to pay for extensions to the open-source
implementations. Founder cites the existence of free E2E deep learning tools
developed by large, company-sponsored teams. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p><a href=https://www.videlibri.de/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Library app VideLibri - All libraries and libraries in one
app
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>: App to track books borrowed from a library.
Founder cites reduced library foot traffic; admits to not realizing that people
believe that they&rsquo;ll return a book in time and thus unlikely to pay for the
app&rsquo;s insurance. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p><a href=https://wifimask.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>WifiMask VPN - Fast VPN + CyberShieldâ„¢
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>. Too hard to
compete with the VPN incumbents w/ big marketing budgets. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p>UI library widgets in Flash for a Windows-like UX inside of a Flash app.
However, the next version of Flash included all of those UI widgets. Founder
cites being unaware of the roadmap of the products you&rsquo;re consuming. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p><a href=https://hoteliera.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Free Hotel Property Management System which increases revenue through Local

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>Founder spent 9
months building it; talked to 1 hotel owner; found out it&rsquo;s hard to sell it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><p>Trying to dethrone Craigslist in 2007. Actual user IDs and feedback system
weren&rsquo;t enough. Implemented endless feature requests from radio station
websites, instead of being judicious about which features to build (&ldquo;The Mom
Test&rdquo;). Didn&rsquo;t scale well because lots of content moderation was needed. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HN2020-12-30></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=HN2021-07-14>Ask HN: Failed project you spent 15 hours/week for 5 years on? | Hacker News<i>.</i></cite>
