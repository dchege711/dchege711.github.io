<i class="fas fa-fw fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden=true></i></div><p>Rain-fed agriculture is the dominant source of food production and income for most of the rural poor. Climate change may make matters worse by increasing variability of rainfall predictions. Even the intra-season variability can have a major effect on crop productivity. To make it worse, semi-arid regions have more variability in seasonal rainfall totals.</p><h3 id=coping-strategies-in-sub-saharan-africa-ssa>Coping Strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)</h3><p>The coping strategies are designed to mitigate risk. They fail to exploit the average & better than average seasons. Farmers tend to over-estimate the negatives and under-estimate the positives.</p><p>Many small-scale rural farmers don&rsquo;t have the ability to diversify their livelihood. Promising areas are drought-resistant varieties and better water management.</p><h3 id=the-importance-of-climate-analytical-tools>The Importance of Climate Analytical Tools</h3><p>As climate analytical tools get better, we gain greater understanding of the variability. This can help rain-fed agriculture on two fronts.</p><h4 id=seasonal-weather-forecasting>Seasonal Weather Forecasting</h4><p>Farmers are constrained by the timing, scale and format of conventional forecasts. They do not trust nor comprehend the forecasts. With competent guidance, seasonal forecasts would go a long way.</p><p>Furthermore, such forecasts could be used for disaster preparedness by feeding them into crop growth simulation models that provide probabilistic crop yield and production estimates in advance of the harvest.</p><h4 id=characterizing-and-mapping-the-agricultural-implications-of-climatic-variability>Characterizing and Mapping the Agricultural Implications of Climatic Variability</h4><p>Crops principally respond to sequences of daily rainfall. Daily data (of which there&rsquo;s a ton) can help predict a wide range of parameters, e.g. <em>start of growing season, frequency of intra-season dry spells, high intensity erosive rainfall, length of growing season, success of crop, water & soil management strategies, etc.</em></p><h5 id=case-study-nitrogen-fertilizers-in-semi-arid-zimbabwe-for-maize>Case Study: Nitrogen Fertilizers in Semi-Arid Zimbabwe for Maize</h5><p>Agricultural Productions Systems Simulator, APSIM, was used. N-fertilizer is recommended at \(52 kg/ha\). Farmers consider the recommendation too risky and expensive - but they <em>could</em> do \(17 kg/ha\).</p><p>Using 46 years of daily climactic data, APSIM simulated maize yields with \(0 kg/ha\), \(17 kg/ha\) and \(52 kg/ha\).</p><p>Except in very bad years, rates of return from the \(17 kg/ha\) were substantially better. This provided quantified risk and opportunities of N-fertilizer use. The \(17 kg/ha\) was applied and despite below-average rains, micro-dosing increased maize yields by 30% to 50%.</p><p>Providing &lsquo;on the spot&rsquo; answers to farmers' climate risk management concerns aroused enormous interest amongst farmer groups. This may directly help farmers in their decision making.</p><h5 id=limitations-of-daily-climatic-data>Limitations of (Daily) Climatic Data</h5><p>The climate data is usually collected at specific weather stations, making interpolation of outputs between weather stations problematic.</p><h2 id=indigenous-knowledge-ik-related-to-climate-variability-and-change-speranza-2009>Indigenous Knowledge (IK) Related to Climate Variability and Change [Speranza, 2009]</h2><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-graduation-cap" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Speranza2009>Indigenous knowledge related to climate variability and change: insights from droughts in semi-arid areas of former Makueni District, Kenya<i>.</i></cite>

Within this 22%, 16% believe IK to be reliable.</p><p>Poverty strongly determines capabilities of preventive measures. Less than a third could take any adaptive measures against the foreseen impacts of the 1999/2000 drought. Therefore, many agro-pastoralists' decisions regarding adverse rainfall variability are of a contingent and reactive nature.</p><h3 id=on-the-future-of-ik>On the Future of IK</h3><p>People well-versed in IK are dying out. IK is no longer systematically passed to the next generations. IK is not incorporated into current curriculum, and even then as second-hand knowledge because people do not experience it themselves</p><p>As climate changes, plants adapt. The future use of biotic objects for climate change monitoring is limited.</p><p>IK derived from climatic variables like temperature, wind direction, rainfall amounts and patterns can still provide valuable information on climate change. But these indicators require continuous monitoring as they also change.</p><h2 id=resilience-in-agriculture-through-crop-diversification-lin-2011>Resilience in Agriculture through Crop Diversification [Lin, 2011]</h2><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-graduation-cap" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Lin2011>Resilience in agriculture through crop diversification: adaptive management for environmental change<i>.</i></cite>
