The risk-free rate is usually the return from a 3-month treasury bill. Higher Sharpe Ratios are better.</p><p>Smart beta argues that pure indexing (weighting by market cap) is not optimal. The portfolio should be tilted in some direction.</p><h3 id=four-tasty-flavors-pros-and-cons>Four Tasty Flavors: Pros and Cons</h3><h4 id=value-wins>Value Wins</h4><p>Dodd and Graham argued that value wins over time. Stocks with low P/E and low P/B (B = book value) are high value stocks. Note that future growth projections are not used.</p><p>But also note that companies in financial distress usually sell at low P/E and P/B, e.g. Citigroup and BoA in 2009 when people thought they&rsquo;d get nationalized, wiping out equity.</p><h4 id=smaller-is-better>Smaller Is Better</h4><p>Small-company stocks tend to generate larger returns than large-company stocks. Recall that they&rsquo;re more risky.</p><p>Sometimes the stocks may have some illiquidity, so it&rsquo;s not always a slam dunk.</p><h4 id=short-term-momentum-exists>Short-Term Momentum Exists</h4><p>Individuals tend to flock to stocks that are rising.</p><p>Investors don&rsquo;t adjust their expectations immediately after news reports.</p><h4 id=low-beta-stocks-return-as-much-as-high-beta-stocks>Low-Beta Stocks Return as Much as High-Beta Stocks</h4><p>The low \( \beta \) stocks can improve the investorâ€™s risk-return tradeoff.</p><h3 id=what-could-go-wrong-in-a-smart-beta-portfolio>What Could Go Wrong in a Smart Beta Portfolio?</h3><p>Rebalancing can involve considerable transactions costs.</p><p>If the factor returns are caused be behavioral errors rather than risk, the strategy will be self-defeating as more investments flow into smart-beta products.</p><p>Smart beta with single-factor products has underperformed.</p><h3 id=blended-factor-strategies>Blended Factor Strategies</h3><p>If correlation between factors is small or negative, factor diversification helps.</p><p>Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA, $500b AUM in 2018) use size and value factors from Fama-French, and tilt toward recent price momentum and profitability growth. Advisers are unconflicted - they don&rsquo;t collect extra fees for placing investors in particular funds. However, they charge advisory fees, e.g. 1%.</p><p>Research Affiliates Fundamental Index (RAFI, $200b AUM) claim pure indexing has too many overpriced growth stocks. They use economic footprints (e.g. earnings and assets) to weight stocks. RAFI performed well post 2009 because large-bank stocks were low compared to book value.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Active Beta ETF uses good value, strong momentum, high quality, and low volatility.</p><h3 id=equally-weighted-portfolios>Equally-Weighted Portfolios</h3><p>Their diversification and risk characteristics differ from those of capitalization-weighted portfolios.</p><p>They are also tax inefficient, as rebalancing involves selling stocks that have risen the most in price.</p><h3 id=implications-for-investors>Implications for Investors</h3><p>Smart Beta portfolios provide factor tilts at lower expense ratios than those charged by traditional active managers.</p><p>Many single factor ETFs have failed to produce reliable excess returns. Moreover, rebalancing makes these funds less tax efficient than capitalization weighted funds.</p><p>Multifactor &ldquo;smart beta&rdquo; funds take advantage of the low or negative correlations between the factors. They could supplement a broad-based core index portfolio.</p><p>Smart beta portfolios are more of marketing hype than smarter investing. They may be self-defeating as &ldquo;value&rdquo; and &ldquo;small size&rdquo; become richly priced.</p><h2 id=the-risk-parity-technique>The Risk-Parity Technique</h2><p>Tilt towards relatively safe assets with modest returns and low volatility. Leverage up this safe portfolio to increase risk and return.</p><p>People tend to overpay for moonshot stocks. Very safe securities appear to offer higher returns than their risk level commands.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Security</th><th>Average Annual Return, 2007 - 2016 (%)</th><th>Standard Deviation, 2007 - 2016 (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S&P 500</td><td>8.6</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>10-Year U.S. Treasury Bond</td><td>5.1</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Leveraged Bond Investment (50% margin)</td><td>10.2</td><td>1.6</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Many institutional portfolios contain 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. A risk-parity portfolio increases the bonds (or fixed-income) portion.</p><h3 id=building-a-risk-parity-portfolio>Building a Risk-Parity Portfolio</h3><p>Risk-parity portfolios typically include real estate assets, commodity funds, treasury inflation-protected securities, etc.</p><p>As long as the added asset class has a relatively low correlation, the addition lowers the volatility of the overall portfolio.</p><p>Note that there&rsquo;s no active portfolio management, just adjusting such that all components contribute equally to portfolio risk.</p><h3 id=what-could-go-wrong-in-an-rp-portfolio>What Could Go Wrong in an RP Portfolio?</h3><p>A levered investor may be forced to liquidate his position during a sharp downturn in prices, turning a temporary loss into a permanent one.</p><p>The other asset classes may fail to produce adequate risk premiums or deviate from their expected correlation.</p></article><div style=font-size:smaller></div></div><footer><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/business/malkiel-a-random-walk-down-wall-street/part-3-the-new-investment-technology/malkiel-10-behavioral-finance/>&#171; 10.
