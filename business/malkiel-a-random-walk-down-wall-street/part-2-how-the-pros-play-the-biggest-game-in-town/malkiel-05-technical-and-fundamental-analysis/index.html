violation of this tenet.</p></div></div><p>Prices tend to move in trends, e.g. a stock that is rising tends to keep on
rising.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all about reading the charts, forget the underlying company: Connect the
tops and bottoms of the days' trades. See a head-and-shoulders formation? The
market has topped out, etc.</p><h3 id=the-rationale-for-the-charting-method>The Rationale for the Charting Method</h3><ol><li>Mass psychology makes trends perpetuate themselves.</li><li>Unequal access to fundamental information about a company.</li><li>Investors often under-react initially to new information.</li></ol><p><strong>Resistance Area:</strong> if a stock bought at $50 stayed there and then dipped to
$40, people will be itching to sell when it hits $50 again, making it hard to
cross $50. $50 is the resistance area.</p><p><strong>Support Levels:</strong> stock was trading at $10; investors didn&rsquo;t buy; stock rises;
stock comes back to $10. Investors will jump at the new chance. $10 is a support
level.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Guilty of this when it comes to the 52-week price range shown by Fidelity. If
the current price is on the lower end, I&rsquo;m usually more optimistic to buy
because I expect that it&rsquo;ll eventually scale back to a previous high. I&rsquo;m an
overall optimist when it comes to the market in general, and that seems like a
prevalent standpoint.</p></div></div><h3 id=why-might-charting-fail-to-work>Why Might Charting Fail to Work?</h3><ol><li>Buying/selling after trend makes the chartist often miss the boat.</li><li>As more and more people use it, the value of any technique depreciates.</li><li>Profit-maximizing behavior. If some know that the price will go to $40
tomorrow, they&rsquo;ll buy today until the price hits $40.</li></ol><h2 id=fundamental-analysis>Fundamental Analysis</h2><p>Fundamental analysis applies the firm-foundation theory to the selection of
individual stocks. Strives to be relatively immune to the crowd. Makes a sharp
distinction between a stock’s current price and its true value.</p><h3 id=determinants-for-calculating-the-true-value>Determinants for Calculating the &ldquo;True Value&rdquo;</h3><h4 id=determinant-1-expected-growth-rate>Determinant 1: Expected Growth Rate</h4><p>Compound growth is under-appreciated. For periodic compounding, the doubling
time for an interest rate of \(r\) percent per period is:</p><p>$$ t = \frac{ln(2)}{ln(1 + r/100)} \approx \frac{72}{r} $$</p><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiRuleOf72></a></span></p><p>Example of reconciling to market prices: <em>if 5% growth stocks sell at 13 P/E, reject a 5% growth stock trading at 20 P/E</em></p><p>But it gets harder for companies to keep growing at the same rate&mldr;</p><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>What then makes the S&P 500 to keep on rising?

dividends or buybacks.</p><h4 id=determinant-3-degree-of-risk>Determinant 3: Degree of Risk</h4><p>The bigger the swings in stock prices (relative to market) & annual returns, the
greater the risk.</p><p>Other things equal, pay more, the less risky the company’s stock.</p><h4 id=determinant-4-market-interest-rates>Determinant 4: Market Interest Rates</h4><p>High interest rates offer a stable profitable alternative to the stock market.</p><h3 id=caveats>Caveats</h3><p>Future expectations cannot be presently proven. Optimism and pessimism make it
hard to be objective.</p><p>Precise figures cannot be calculated from undetermined data. There an unfounded
assumptions, e.g. Why a growth period of 10 years?</p><p>Perception of growth rates are not always comparable between time periods.
Before the dot-com boom, high-growth stocks traded at a modest premium over P/E
multiples of common stocks. Not so in the late 90s and early 00s.</p><h3 id=why-might-fundamental-analysis-fail-to-work>Why Might Fundamental Analysis Fail to Work?</h3><p>Maybe the information will be worthless: good and bad info cancels out, acting
on the information incurs transaction fees, mistranslations of facts into
earnings estimates.</p><p>All the information available to the analyst may already be reflected.</p><p>The market might correct its &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; by revaluing all stocks downward, rather
than raising the price for your target stock.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Is this more probable than the other way round? Seems like we&rsquo;re working with
small probabilities. Even on the other hand, what are the chances that me as an
