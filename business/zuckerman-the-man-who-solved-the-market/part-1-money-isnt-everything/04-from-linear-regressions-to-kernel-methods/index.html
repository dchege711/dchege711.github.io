This was above and beyond what Straus was hired for.</p><p>Straus foraged and cleaned data that the rest of the world cared little about. He looked for unusual spikes, dips and gaps.</p><p>Ax and Straus moved to the West Coast, forming Axcom. Simons received 25% of the profits and agreed to provide trading help and communicate with the new firm&rsquo;s clients.</p><h2 id=carmona-brings-in-the-stochastic-guns>Carmona Brings in the Stochastic Guns</h2><p>Axcom needed new ways to make money. Brazilian weather history didn&rsquo;t help predict coffee prices. Public sentiments and holdings of other futures traders didn&rsquo;t help much either.</p><p>Simons, Ax and Straus didn&rsquo;t believe that the market was truly a random walk. A probability distribution could capture future prices as well as any other stochastic process.</p><p>Carmona (Irvine -> Princeton) was brought in for his knowledge of stochastic processes. Linear regressions did not do shit despite more data. Carmona started experimenting with kernel methods. Straus was running out of data - he even started to model data.</p><p>In Long Island, Laufer was also using kernel methods to analyze patterns in data sets. He was set to share with Simons.</p><p>Simons wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the kernels. They couldn&rsquo;t reduce them to a set of standard equations.</p></article><div style=font-size:smaller></div></div><footer><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/business/zuckerman-the-man-who-solved-the-market/part-1-money-isnt-everything/03-markov-chains-potatoes-and-hodl/>&#171; 03: Markov Chains, Potatoes and HODL</a></footer></section></div><footer><a href=mailto:d.chege711@gmail.com>Email</a>
