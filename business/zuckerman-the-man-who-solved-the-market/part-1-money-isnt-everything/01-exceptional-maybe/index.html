Something like, if you keep moving half the distance, how many moves do you need to make in order to touch some object? The expected answer was impossible, but I didn&rsquo;t buy it. Zeno was being taken out of context. Touching something doesn&rsquo;t mean zero distance between your hand and the thing. Close enough to get the touch sensation fired up is all we need. Unless we&rsquo;re talking nuclear reactors, get that Zeno logic outta here.</p></div></div><p>Simons was not exceptional among his colleagues. But he could mull problems
until he arrived at original solutions.</p><p>The gateway drug for Simons was soybeans futures that had couple grand of
