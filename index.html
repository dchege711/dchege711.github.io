    <a href="https://notes.c13u.com/"><h3>Flashcards by c13u (Web Application)</h3></a>

    <p>
        I read a lot but remember too little. I also needed a side project that 
        would not die out soon. 'Flashcards by c13u' was thus born. It supports LaTeX, 
        syntax highlighting and markdown. Give it a spin if you can!

        <h3>Kenyans Applying to US Universities (College Guide)</h3>
    </a>

    <p>
        A college guide for Kenyan high school students/graduates who are 
        applying to undergraduate programs in the US. We need more voluntary 
        essay editors, so if you're down, let me know!
