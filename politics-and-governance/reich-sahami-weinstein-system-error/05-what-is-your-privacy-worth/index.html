    <div class="comment"><p>Pre-read thoughts.</p>
<p>I think for the general population, the value of privacy is not worth the
inconvenience associated with securing it, in the cases where it&rsquo;s not readily
availed by Big Tech. For example, one wouldn&rsquo;t go out of their way to not have
passwords and 2FA. However, when it comes to matters like online privacy, most
folks are willing to allow surveillance in exchange for free services like web
search, social media, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Meta point: Managing the trade-off between privacy and safety, or between
privacy and innovation.</p>
<h2 id="the-wild-west-of-data-collection">The Wild West of Data Collection</h2>
<p>US govt developed the Clipper Chip for backdoor access (access that&rsquo;d be granted
under court order) to encrypted consumer electronics. Due to public criticism,
the Clinton administration abandoned the project. In the wake of 9/11, the USA
PATRIOT Act was passed enabling sweeping programs to collect communications
without judicial authorization. Snowden&rsquo;s leaks prompted some reforms, but the
public had already been desensitized a bit.</p>
<p>Although the government is responsible for security, and has stricter data
handling laws, it faces more criticism than companies who do the same. This
might be because companies provide direct tangible benefits, e.g. access to
information, connecting to friends, etc. Furthermore, while you can switch
between companies, you can&rsquo;t easily switch your government.</p>
<p>The FTC touts the &ldquo;Notice and Consent&rdquo; framework. However, <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Deloitte2017"></a></span> found that a vast users don&rsquo;t read/understand the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Sometimes companies ship default privacy decisions that omit the broader
implications. For example, Google Buzz (2010) shipped with publicly available
contacts. One user had her abusive ex-husband find comments posted to her
boyfriend, including current location and workplace.</p>
<h2 id="a-digital-panopticon">A Digital Panopticon?</h2>
<p>Bentham proposed the prison panopticon (allows watchman to observe prison&rsquo;s
occupants without their knowing whether they&rsquo;re being watched) as a way of using
fewer guards while increasing security because of easy surveillance. Foucault in
the 1970s revisited the idea in the context of modern civilian surveillance that
amounts to social control.</p>
<p>The value of privacy is not to hide illicit behavior, but to have control over
oneself and information about oneself, e.g. insurance companies not having our
medical records, exercising freedoms like protesting without fear of reprisals,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="from-the-panopticon-to-a-digital-blackout">From the Panopticon to a Digital Blackout</h2>
<p>E2E encryption in messaging apps form a technical barrier, as opposed to a
policy one, for LEO trying to read message contents. However, these same apps
are also used by people with malicious intent!</p>
<h2 id="technology-alone-wont-save-us">Technology Alone Won&rsquo;t Save Us</h2>
<p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Sweeney"></a></span> showed that anonymized records can be de-anonymized
using auxilliary data. For example, 87% of Americans are uniquely identifiable
through 3 attributes: zip code, birth date, and gender.</p>
<p>Differential Privacy is a better alternative to PII-scrubbing that enables
beneficial analysis of data without compromising an individual&rsquo;s privacy. That
said, information can be leaked from repeated queries to the system using DP.</p>

    Differential Privacy

<h2 id="we-cant-count-on-the-market-either">We Can&rsquo;t Count on the Market Either</h2>
<p>Myth 1: The market can deliver a diversity of comparable products with different
privacy settings.</p>
<p>Apple famously declined installing an iPhone backdoor for the FBI in the wake of
the San Bernadino shooting. However, Apple is in the high-end product business
and not in the user data monetization business, and can therefore choose to
stand for privacy.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s privacy-sensitive search model has not won much share of the search
market. For example, before EU&rsquo;s 2018 antitrust action, Google made it hard for
users to not use Google Search on Android.</p>
<h2 id="a-privacy-paradox">A Privacy Paradox</h2>
<p>Myth 2: People have informed preferences about the amount of privacy they want,
and are able to act on these preferences.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">

<p>Potential harms from giving up privacy are intangible/invisible to most, and
therefore weigh less on our minds.</p>
<p>Westin found that people consider themselves privacy fundamentalists, but in
practice, are privacy pragmatists and/or privacy unconcerned, e.g. opting into
frequent-buyer programs for discounts.</p>

</div>


<p>The lack of intrinsic opinions makes privacy preferences more context dependent,
e.g. 9/11, Snowden, COVID-19.</p>
<p>Companies systematically capitalize on people&rsquo;s amorphous privacy preferences,
e.g. privacy-invasive defaults, dark patterns, incomprehensible ToS, etc.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-privacy-for-the-benefit-of-society">Protecting Privacy for the Benefit of Society</h2>
<p>Myth 3: We can achieve both our personal and societal goals via a set of
decentralized decisions we each make about how much privacy we want.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Look up Daniel Solove&rsquo;s work on evaluating benefits and costs of privacy
protection cumulatively and holistically.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Apple and Google built privacy features into their contact tracing APIs.
However, the success of contact tracing ultimately rests on people&rsquo;s willingness
to enroll and update their health status.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t depend on malicious actors, e.g. terrorists, traffickers, etc., to
voluntarily disclose information. We need rigorous legal and judicial to
determine who can violate people&rsquo;s privacy and with what legitimate
authorization when there is a credible threat to security.</p>
<h2 id="four-letters-that-are-key-to-your-privacy">Four Letters That Are Key to Your Privacy</h2>
<p>GDPR (2016), partly buoyed by Snowden&rsquo;s leaks, differs from the US &ldquo;Notice and
Choice&rdquo; approach.GDPR granted new digital rights to EU residents, e.g. companies
must inform users of data collection, the purpose of the collection, and who has
access; users can obtain, correct, erase and transfer their data; users can stop
companies from processing their data, etc. GDPR fines can be up to 4% of the
company&rsquo;s global revenues.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-gdpr">Beyond GDPR</h2>
<p>California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) gives CA consumers rights to know
about data collected; to delete data (with some exceptions); to opt out of the
sale of their data; to non-discrimination for exercising CCPA rights.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>The CCPA had roots in California&rsquo;s ballot initiative process, and was
spearheaded by real estate billionaire Alastair Mactaggart.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2 id="desirable-outcomes-of-privacy-laws-that-serves-citizens">Desirable Outcomes of Privacy Laws that Serves Citizens</h2>
<p>Treating privacy as a right, as opposed to a preference, to shift power from
companies to citizens.</p>
<p>A commitment to more meaningful forms of consent, e.g. narrow and understandable
ToSs, sensible defaults, privacy preferences that can shared between platforms,
etc.</p>
<p>A credible, legitimate government agency that has the power to preserve and
protect the privacy rights defined by new legislation. The FTC is regarded
toothless in the Notice and Choice world.</p>
