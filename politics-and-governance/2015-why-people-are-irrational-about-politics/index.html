<p>Salient features of political disagreements: widespread (many people disagree on
many issues), strong conviction/confidence, and persistent (difficult to
resolve).</p>
<h2 id="political-disputes-are-not-explained-by-miscalculation-or-ignorance">Political Disputes Are Not Explained by Miscalculation or Ignorance</h2>
<p>Miscalculation Theory: Political issues are difficult and partisans make
mistakes in their reasoning.</p>
<p>Ignorance Theory: Partisans have insufficient/different information available to
them.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Having been relatively well-educated, I tend to think that we only need to make
sure that everyone is well-educated. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Huemer2015"></a></span> notes that it&rsquo;s
harder to resolve disputes with the educated &amp; biased than with the non-educated
&amp; biased.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Partisans regard their political beliefs as not difficult to verify.
Furthermore, the presence of others with opposing beliefs does not shake their
confidence.</p>
<p>If the disagreements were due to ignorance, then partisans would be aware of
their level of ignorance, and not be as confident.</p>
<p>Partisans do commonly share their reasons and evidence, but the disputes
persist.</p>
<p>Political beliefs corelate with non-cognitive traits, e.g. minorities are more
likely to support affirmative action. This correlation suggests bias, rather
than miscalculation, plays a major role.</p>
<p>Logically unrelated political beliefs do cluster, e.g. supporting gun control
and abortion rights. Sometimes, the correlations are opposite, e.g. abortion
rights and animal rights. Even if some cluster of beliefs is &ldquo;the truth&rdquo;, we&rsquo;d
not expect a sizeable number of people with belief clusters systematically
directed away from &ldquo;the truth&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="political-disputes-are-not-explained-by-divergent-values">Political Disputes Are Not Explained by Divergent-Values</h2>
<p>Divergent-Values Theory: Political issues turn on moral/evaluative issues, and
people have divergent fundamental values.</p>
<p>Why would people have different fundamental values? Many people falsely think
that value questions have no objective answers, and they&rsquo;re a matter of personal
feelings/preferences.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Huemer2015"></a></span> says that &ldquo;moral anti-realism is entirely unjustified&rdquo;
and links to some paper that I&rsquo;m yet to locate.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Given the clustering of political beliefs, there should be some core moral claim
for liberals, and one for conservatives. However, sometimes the predictions from
a fundamental moral theory are wrong (e.g. abortion and animal rights).</p>
<p>Most importantly, many political disputes involve factual disputes too, e.g.
effect of gun control laws on violent crime.</p>
<h2 id="rational-ignorance-and-rational-irrationality">Rational Ignorance and Rational Irrationality</h2>
<p>The Irrationality Theory: People disagree about political issues mainly because
most people are irrational when it comes to politics.</p>
<p>The cost of collecting information may be greater than the expected value of
that information, e.g. researching candidate X doesn&rsquo;t matter if the rest of the
voters are going to vote for whomever they were going to vote for before you
collected the information.</p>
<p>The cost of rational beliefs may exceed their benefits, e.g. being more rational
about immigrants' ability to run convenience marts than immigrants' general
effects on society.</p>
<p>Rational Irrationality assumes that there are certain things that people <em>want</em>
to believe, and that individuals can exercise some control on their beliefs.</p>
<h3 id="sources-of-belief-preferences">Sources of Belief Preferences</h3>
<p>People tend to hold political beliefs that, if generally accepted, would benefit
themselves or the group they identify with, e.g. the poor are much more likely
to believe in the justice of redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>People prefer to hold the political beliefs that best fit with the images of
themselves that they want to adopt and to project, e.g. advocating increases in
military spending to showcase their toughness.</p>
<p>People prefer to hold the political beliefs of other people they like and want
to associate with. Groups therefore tend to converge over time, even when the
cluster of beliefs converged on was largely a matter of historical accident.</p>
<p>People are biased towards beliefs that &lsquo;fit well&rsquo; with their existing beliefs,
e.g. few think both that capital punishment deters crime, and that many innocent
people are convicted.</p>
<h3 id="mechanisms-of-belief-fixation">Mechanisms of Belief Fixation</h3>
<p>Biased weighting of evidence. Relatedly, people have easier times remembering
facts/experiences that support our beliefs.</p>
<p>Selective attention and energy. People think more of arguments that support
their beliefs. People are more likely to accept supportive arguments at face
value, and look for flaws in opposing arguments.</p>
<p>Many people choose to listen mainly or solely to those they agree with.</p>
<p>For most controversial social issues, there will be anecdotes that support
either side, e.g. O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s trial as a failure of the American justice
system.</p>
<p>Use of subjective statements that necessitate judgment calls, e.g. &ldquo;American TV
programs are very violent&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;The number of deaths portrayed in an average
hour of American TV programming is greater than the number of deaths portrayed
in an average hour of British TV programming&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Use of speculative arguments for which we lack decisive evidence for or against
them, e.g. &ldquo;The Civil War was primarily caused by economic motives&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to Do</h2>
<p>Explicit awareness of the mechanisms of belief fixation should cause one to
avoid using them.</p>
<p>We should identify cases in which we are particularly likely to be biased, and
in those cases hesitate to affirm the beliefs that we would be biased towards.</p>
<p>Hesitate to affirm beliefs that we&rsquo;d be biased towards: own interests are
involved; strong feelings; traditional clustering, e.g. liberal; can be
predicted given race, sex, occupation, personality traits; existing beliefs
before gathering empirical data, or persistent beliefs despite contradicting
data.</p>
<p>Given others' irrationality, adjust confidence in reported information. Weigh
both sides before accepting an argument.</p>
<p>When debating, avoid insulting the individual or the group they identify with.
Aim for a suspense of judgment rather than conversion, e.g. &ldquo;what evidence is
relevant to X?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;is X true?&rdquo;. Most times, neither party has the
necessary data.</p>
<p>Display fair-mindedness: qualify claims; acknowledge contradicting evidence and
correct points made by the other interlocutor.</p>
