a child&rsquo;s viewpoint. I can relate to John Lewis more at a young age because we
have shared experiences, but his were in a segregated environment whereas mine
weren&rsquo;t.</p></div></div><p>The thing is, when I was young, there wasn&rsquo;t much of a civil rights movement.
I wanted to work at <strong>something,</strong> but I grew up in rural Alabama. My parents
knew it would be <strong>dangerous</strong> to make any waves. &ldquo;Stay out of trouble. Don&rsquo;t
get in white people&rsquo;s way.&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Do younger generations tend to be more radical than their predecessors? Or maybe
a &ldquo;we walked so you could fly&rdquo; phenomenon? That&rsquo;s contra to the &ldquo;kids these
days&rdquo; trope that is attributed to the tendency to notice the limitations of
others where one excels and a memory bias projecting one&rsquo;s current qualities
onto the youth of the past. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Protzko2019></a></span></p></div></div><p>Arriving in Buffalo after seventeen hours of travel was an otherworldly
experience. It was so bust, almost frantic. When we reached my uncle O.C.&rsquo;s and
Dink&rsquo;s house, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it &ndash; they had white people living next door to
them. On <strong>both</strong> sides. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Similar situation highlighted in

Walker
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>. Harlem was a place where
non-straight people were free to be themselves.</p></div></div><p>The county didn&rsquo;t bother paving roads into &ldquo;colored&rdquo; communities unless it was
necessary for white traffic to pass through. Our bus itself was an old
hand-me-down, just like our school books. I realized how old it was when we
finally climbed onto the paved highway, the main road running east from Troy,
and passed the white children&rsquo;s buses. We passed their schoolhouses as well,
with nice playground equipment outside &ndash; nothing like our cluster of small
cinderblock buildings with a dirt field out back for recess. We drove past
prison gangs almost every day. The prisoners were always black. As were the
folks working in the fields beyond them. You couldn&rsquo;t help but notice. Despite
everything that confronted me on the way to school, I was in heaven once I
stepped inside it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>The doctrine of &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; &ndash; upon which the entire institution of
segregation was based &ndash; had been ruled unconstitutional. I was so excited &ndash;
surely <strong>everything</strong> was going to change. I thought come fall, I&rsquo;d be riding a
state-of-the-art bus into a state-of-the-art school. An integrated school. Not
everyone was excited. But my parents' attitude didn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much
as those among the ministers at the church who never mentioned the injustices in
their sermons. It did <strong>not</strong> escape my notice that our minister always departed
church in a <strong>very</strong> nice automobile. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>A black farmer named Mose Wright witnessed the two white men dragging Emmett
Till from his relatives' home, and had the courage to testify against them in
open court. The all-white jury found those two white defendants <strong>not guilty.</strong>
A few months later, they even confessed to the murder in <strong>Look</strong> magazine, but
there was nothing to be done &ndash; they had already been tried. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>My mother had a part-time job working at the white baptist offering home in
downtown Troy, Alabama. One day at work, she saw a little paper published by the
Alabama Baptist Convention (which was all-white). It mentioned a school in
Nashville called American Baptist Theological Seminary that was jointly
supported by the white southern baptists <strong>and</strong> black national baptists. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>A lot of happenstance for John Lewis to go to college. On a systemic level, this
fails a lot of children as not everyone will be as lucky as John Lewis was.</p></div></div><h2 id=non-violence>Non-Violence</h2><p>Lawson taught us how to protect ourselves, how to <strong>disarm</strong> our attackers by
connecting with their <strong>humanity,</strong> &ldquo;Maintain eye contact, John!&rdquo; How to protect
each other, how to <strong>survive.</strong> But the hardest part to learn &ndash; to truly
<strong>understand</strong>, deep in your heart &ndash; was how to find <strong>love</strong> for your
attacker. &ldquo;Do <strong>not</strong> let them shake your faith in nonviolence &ndash; <strong>love</strong> them!
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>Do not:</p><ul><li>Strike back or curse if abused.</li><li>Laugh out.</li><li>Hold conversations with floor walker.</li><li>Leave your seat until your leader has given you permission to do so.</li><li>Block entrances to stores outside or the aisles inside.</li></ul><p>Do:</p><ul><li>Show yourself friendly and courteous at all times.</li><li>Sit straight; always face the counter.</li><li>Report all serious incidents to your leader.</li><li>Refer information seekers to your leader in a polite manner.</li><li>Remember the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther
King. Love and nonviolence is the way.
May God bless each of you.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>&ldquo;Your honor &ndash; we feel that by paying these fines, we would be contributing to,
and supporting the injustices and immoral practices that have been performed in
the arrest and conviction of the defendants. Thank you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jail, no bail!&rdquo; &ldquo;Jail,
no bail!&rdquo; &ldquo;Jail, no bail!&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>Quietly &ndash; almost invisibly &ndash; within the local churches, a black community
<strong>boycott</strong> of <strong>all</strong> downtown stores began &ndash; what some people called a
&ldquo;selective buying campaign.&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>MAYOR WEST. Look, you all have the power to <strong>destroy</strong> this city, so let&rsquo;s not
have any mobs. I will do <strong>everything</strong> I can to enforce the laws without
prejudice &ndash; but I have no power to force restaurant owners to serve people they
don&rsquo;t want to&mldr; Little Lady, I stopped segregation seven years ago at the
airport when I first took office, and there has been no trouble since.<br>Then, Mayor &ndash; do you recommend that the lunch counters be desegregated?<br>MAYOR WEST. Yes&mldr; <small>That&rsquo;s up to the store managers, of
course.</small><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>But what we found, as we pushed our protests deeper into the heart of segregated
society, was that our nonviolent actions were met with increasingly more
<strong>violent</strong> responses. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>BUS DRIVER. I&rsquo;m supposed to drive this bus to Dothan, Alabama, through
Montgomery, but I understand there&rsquo;s a big convoy down the road. I only have one
life to give, and I&rsquo;m <strong>not</strong> going to give it to <strong>CORE</strong> or the <strong>NAACP.</strong><br>It may sound strange, but at the time I was more shocked that the bus
driver knew enough about us to reference <strong>CORE</strong> by name. People were starting
to notice us, even if we didn&rsquo;t change their minds.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><h2 id=direct-antagonism>Direct Antagonism</h2><p>The Superintendent himself, <strong>Fred Jones,</strong> greeted us.<br>JONES. We have
some bad niggers here. We have niggers on death row that&rsquo;ll beat you up and cut
you as look at you. Go ahead and sing your goddamn freedom songs now.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>What about the songs bothered them so? Is it the fact that they expect activists
to cower, but singing is the opposite?</p></div></div><p>LEWIS. What they&rsquo;re trying to do is take your <strong>soul</strong> away. It&rsquo;s not the
<strong>mattresses,</strong> it&rsquo;s your <strong>soul</strong> &ndash; Satan put us here for forty days and forty
nights to tempt us with the flesh. He&rsquo;s saying to us, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just stop your
singin' and bail outta here, I&rsquo;ll give you anything you want &ndash; soft, thick
mattresses. Down pillows. <strong>Everything.</strong> &ldquo;Be good boys and I&rsquo;ll let you keep
your mattresses.&rdquo;<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>There were beatings. There were shootings. Four homes of Albany-area voter
registration organizers were riddled with bullets. A few nights later, three
shotgun blasts were fired into a home where Charles Sherrod was sleeping. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>GOV. WALLACE, JR. Today I have stood where once Jefferson Davis stood and took
an oath to my people. It is very appropriate then, that from this cradle of the
confederacy, the very <strong>heart</strong> of the great Anglo-Saxon southland, that today
we should sound the drum for freedom, as have our generations of forebears
before us have done, time and time again throughout <strong>history.</strong> Let us rise to
the call of freedom-loving blood that is in us, and send our answer to the
<strong>tyranny</strong> that clanks its chains upon the south. In the name of the greatest
people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust, and toss the
gauntlet before the feet of <strong>tyranny.</strong> And I say, <strong>segregation today,
segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.</strong> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>So this is the kind of leadership in Alabama that preceded MLK&rsquo;s Letter from
Birmingham Jail.</p></div></div><p>Nearly a <strong>thousand</strong> of Birmingham&rsquo;s black children were arrested that day. It
was an embarrassment to the city.<br>[&mldr;]<br>BULL CONNOR. Do <strong>not</strong>
cross. If you come any further, we <strong>will</strong> turn the fire hoses on you! [&mldr;]
Bring the dogs.<br>I watched the images of television that night and like the
rest of America, I was absolutely <strong>stunned</strong> by what I saw. [&mldr;] In Nashville,
we made sure they were seen, and our ranks grew immediately because of it.

differing viewpoints that they had in the path to liberty for all.</p></div></div><p>THURGOOD MARSHALL. Look, once you&rsquo;ve been arrested, you&rsquo;ve made your point. If
someone offers you to get you out, main &ndash; <strong>get out!</strong><br>Thurgood Marshall
was a good man, but listening to him speak convinced me, more than ever, that
our <strong>revolt</strong> was as much against the traditional black leadership structure as
it was against <strong>segregation</strong> and <strong>discrimination.</strong> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March01></a></span></p><p>Another issue was <strong>Dr. King&rsquo;s</strong> participation in the rides.<br>DIANE.
Martin, are you going to join us? Will you ride with us?<br>KING. I can&rsquo;t go,
Diane. I&rsquo;m still on <strong>probation</strong> from my arrest in Atlanta.<br>MEMBERS. I&rsquo;m
on probation, too! Me too! Same here. Yeah, we&rsquo;re <strong>all</strong> on probation, Dr.
King.<br>KING. I think I should choose the time and place of my GOLGOTHA.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>When he found out that all of the riders had refused to post bail, he called Dr.
King to see if any of us would be willing to reconsider.<br>ROBERT KENNEDY.
<strong>That</strong> is not going to have the slightest effect on what the government is
going to do in this field, or any other. The fact that they stay in jail is not
going to have the slightest effect on me, Dr. King.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Would it be existential to hear that from the allies in power working with you?
It calls for even more conviction from your side that you&rsquo;ll ultimately be
right.</p></div></div><p>In June of 1961, Robert Kennedy suggested to Diane Nash and others that it would
be a better decision for us, in the long run, to focus on <strong>registering Black
voters.</strong> I believed our direct action campaigns were working, and many were
upset at the mere suggestion. But by the end of 1961, Dr. King gave the idea his
full endorsement. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>In April 1962, SNCC held a conference in Atlanta to observe its second
anniversary. It was incredible to see how drastically the organization had
changed in such a short time. [&mldr;] More than a few of the 250 SNCC
representatives in Atlanta that weekend argued that it should be acceptable to
<strong>strike back</strong> if you&rsquo;re hit. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>By the end of 1962, you heard people questioning whether SNCC should even <strong>be</strong>
a multi-racial organization. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>Among the SNCC members, there wasn&rsquo;t much interest in the march <strong>or</strong> President
Kennedy&rsquo;s bill. Many thought the march would be a lame event staged by
conservative Black leaders that was probably, in some way, controlled by the
federal government. As for the Civil Rights Bill &ndash; we could <strong>not</strong> support it.
The Kennedy Bill did <strong>not</strong> guarantee the right of <strong>all</strong> African-Americans to
vote. The administration too the position that, if you had a 6th grade
education, you should be considered <strong>literate</strong> and able to vote. SNCC&rsquo;s
position &ndash; and mine &ndash; was that the <strong>only</strong> qualification for being able to
vote should be that of <strong>age</strong> and <strong>residence.</strong> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>There was one person deliberately <strong>not</strong> invited that day. <strong>Malcolm X</strong> of the
Nation of Islam. I <strong>knew</strong> Malcolm. I <strong>respected</strong> him. I <strong>shared</strong> his
belief that our struggle was not simply in the courts, but in the <strong>streets.</strong>
Still, I never felt like he was part of the movement. Our movement was about
creating an open, integrated society. And, violence, no matter how justified,
was <strong>not</strong> something I could accept. But I could understand his appeal, and the
feeling of restlessness that drove it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>ROY WILKINS. I&rsquo;m telling you, people are going to use him <strong>against</strong> us. He&rsquo;s a
conscientious objector, he&rsquo;s been linked to the communist party, and, of course,
there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;morals&rdquo; charge.<br>Rustin was gay, though no one said it
directly. It made him a strategic liability.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><p>In the end, my speech no longer called the President&rsquo;s bill &ldquo;too little, too
late&rdquo; nor called for a &ldquo;march through the heart of Dixie, the way Sherman did.&rdquo;
It no longer asked, &ldquo;Which side is the government on?&rdquo;, nor described some
political leaders as &ldquo;cheap.&rdquo; But when we were finished, I was still satisfied
with the speech, as were Forman and Cox. We all agreed that our message was
<strong>not</strong> compromised. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#March02></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=March01>March: Book One<i>.</i></cite>
