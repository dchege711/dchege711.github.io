info is used.</p><p>Some privacy harms are tangible, e.g. financial costs associated with identity
theft. Other privacy harms are intangible, e.g. strangers being aware of one&rsquo;s
life history.</p><p>Privacy typically involves trade-offs, e.g. privacy of consumers purchases
protects them from price discrimination but excludes them from targeted offers
and ads.</p><ul><li>[Experiment: Online Shopping] When the search engine only displayed merchant
prices, participants purchased from those offering lowest price. When the
search engine included privacy protection practices in addition to prices,
majority of the participants paid ~5% premium to buy from privacy-protecting
merchants.</li></ul><h3 id=people-tend-to-be-uncertain-about-their-own-privacy-preferences>People tend to be uncertain about their own privacy preferences</h3><p>[Experiment: Participants asked sensitive and potentially incriminating
questions] When the questions were followed by assurances of confidentiality,
participants had lower divulgence! Their privacy concerns went up.</p><p>[Westin&rsquo;s Experiment: Used broad privacy questions in surveys to cluster people
as privacy fundamentalists, pragmatists, and unconcerned] The Privacy Paradox:
most people, when asked directly, consider themselves privacy fundamentalists.</p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;One might care deeply about privacy in general but, depending on the costs
and benefits prevailing in a specific situation, seek or not seek privacy
protection&rdquo;</p><ul><li><p>But the paradox persists even under high correspondence between expressed
concerns and behavioral actions. [Experiment] Within the subset that had the
highest degree of concern of strangers knowing their sexual orientation,
political views and partner&rsquo;s names, 48% publicly revealed their sexual
orientation, 47% their political orientation and 21% their current partner&rsquo;s
name.</p></li><li><p>Privacy decision-making is also affected by misperceptions of those costs
and benefits, as well as social norms, emotions, and heuristics. Any of
these factors may affect behavior differently from how they affect
attitudes.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Preference uncertainty is also evident in studies that estimate monetary
valuations of privacy.</p><ul><li><p>[Experiment] Subjects valued protection against errors, improper access, and
secondary use of personal information between $30.49 and $44.62.</p></li><li><p>Attempts to pinpoint exact valuations that people assign to privacy may be
misguided. [Experiment: Some subjects given $10 anonymous gift card, others
given $12 traceable gift card. Later presented with option to switch] Of the
$10 card holders, 52.1% chose to keep the $10 card. Of the $12 card holders,
9.7% switched to the $10 card. Maybe people value privacy more when they have
it than when they do not.</p></li></ul><p>Also, people have a powerful desire to be public, share and disclose. This may
trump the desire for privacy.</p><h2 id=context-dependence-of-peoples-concern-about-privacy>Context-Dependence of People&rsquo;s Concern About Privacy</h2><p>Depending on the situation, people exhibit anything ranging from extreme concern
to apathy about privacy.</p><p>Usually, we may be more comfortable sharing secrets with friends, but at times
we may overshare with a stranger on a plane</p><p>[Study] Social network users over time increased the amount of personal
information revealed to their friends while simultaneously decreasing the
amounts revealed to strangers</p><p>People use cues to judge the importance of privacy, sometimes in unexpected
ways:</p><ul><li><p>Presence of government regulation reduces consumer concern and increase trust;
people infer the existence of some degree of privacy protection</p></li><li><p>[Experiment] Subjects revealed more personal and incriminating info on an
unprofessionally designed website with a &lsquo;How Bard R U&rsquo; banner than on a site
with formal interface. The latter was even deemed safer.</p></li><li><p>Oneâ€™s culture and other people&rsquo;s behavior, either through the mechanism of
descriptive norms (imitation) or via reciprocity. If others are revealing
information, people seem to reason unconsciously, doing so oneself must be
desirable or safe.</p></li></ul><p>Privacy concerns are often a function of past experiences.</p><p>Surveillance can produce discomfort and negatively affect worker productivity.
However, privacy concern is adaptive.</p><p>[Experiment] Installation of monitoring tech in households made the families
initially change their behavior, especially w.r.t. conversations, nudity and
sex. Yet, if they accidentally walked naked in front of the sensors, they showed
less concern about repeating the behavior.</p><h2 id=malleability-and-influence>Malleability and Influence</h2><p>Disclosure of personal information powers industries like online social networks
to behavioral advertising. Some entities have an interest in promoting
disclosure.</p><p>Use of default settings. Sticking to default settings is convenient, and people
often interpret default settings as implicit recommendations</p><p>Malicious Interface Design. Websites frustrate or even confuse users into
disclosing personal information</p><p>Commercial entities choose not to ring alarm bells avoid raising privacy
concerns. When they do, it&rsquo;s usually a personalized ad with an irresistible
deal.</p><p>[Study] 62% incorrectly believed that the existence of a privacy policy implied
that a site could not share their personal information without permission</p><p>[Study] Control can reduce privacy concern. Participants provided with greater
explicit control over which info could be published ended up sharing more
sensitive information with a broader audience</p><p>Increasing the transparency of firmsâ€™ data practices doesn&rsquo;t quite work:</p><ul><li>Most internet users do not read privacy policies</li><li>Few users would benefit from doing so; most policies are in lawyer-speak</li></ul><p>The feeling of being observed and accountable can induce people to engage in
prosocial behaviors or (for better or for worse) adhere to social norms</p><ul><li>[Experiment] Disinhibition Effect. Darkness caused participants in an
experiment to cheat in order to gain more money.</li><li>[Experiment] Anonymity can lead to prosocial behavior. Higher willingness to
share money in a dictator game, when coupled with priming of religiosity</li></ul><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>Uncertainty and context-dependence imply that people cannot always be counted on
to navigate the complex trade-offs involving privacy in a self-interested
fashion</p><p>Malleability implies that people are easily influenced in what and how much they
disclose.</p><p>Informing/empowering the individual is unlikely to provide adequate protection.
(See transparency and finer control)</p><p>To be effective, privacy policy should protect real people - who are naÃ¯ve,
uncertain and vulnerable - and should be flexible enough to evolve with the
complexities of the information age.</p></article><div style=font-size:smaller><aside id=authors-holder style="margin:0 0 2%">Cited Authors:
