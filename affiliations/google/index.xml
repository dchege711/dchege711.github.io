Initially rated myself based on % of completed daily objectives. The objectives didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily correspond to work items. Stopped because the numbers were high even on days when I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel productive.
Switched to &amp;ldquo;stuff that affects others&amp;rdquo; (later came to know these are &amp;ldquo;function points&amp;rdquo;). More intuitively captures non-code objectives, e.g., aligning folks on feature specs.</description></item><item><title>Debugging</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/debugging/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/debugging/</guid><description>Debugging 101 Definition? Debugging involves inspecting a program&amp;rsquo;s internal state.
printf Debugging and Logging In printf debugging, one adds print statements and keeps iterating until enough information has been extracted.
Using logging has several advantages over printf debugging: varying logging destinations (e.g. standard output, files, sockets, remote servers, etc.); severity levels (e.g. INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &amp;amp;c) that support filtering of output; color-coding for readability.
Terminals have varying levels of color support: plain color; ANSI escape codes (16 color codes with bold/italic and background); 256 color palette; 24-bit truecolor (&amp;ldquo;888&amp;rdquo; colors, aka 16 million, e.</description></item><item><title>[ToDo] Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common LISP</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/todo/ai-and-machine-learning/paradigms-of-ai-programming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 1992 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/todo/ai-and-machine-learning/paradigms-of-ai-programming/</guid><description>The Common Lisp Programming Language
