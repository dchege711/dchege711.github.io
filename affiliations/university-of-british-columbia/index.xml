Initially rated myself based on % of completed daily objectives. The objectives didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily correspond to work items. Stopped because the numbers were high even on days when I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel productive.
Switched to &amp;ldquo;stuff that affects others&amp;rdquo; (later came to know these are &amp;ldquo;function points&amp;rdquo;). More intuitively captures non-code objectives, e.g., aligning folks on feature specs.</description></item><item><title>Software Engineering Journal Reviews</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-01-16-swe-journal-reviews/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-01-16-swe-journal-reviews/</guid><description>Formal Software Design Alloy is an open-source language and analyzer for software modeling. An Alloy model is a collection of constraints that describe a set of structures, e.g. all possible security configurations of a web application. Alloy&amp;rsquo;s tool, the Alloy Analyzer is a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them.
ðŸ“‘ The Alloy Analyzer leverages a SAT solver, and this precludes Alloy from analyzing optimization problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
