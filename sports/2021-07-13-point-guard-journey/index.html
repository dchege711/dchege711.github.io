<!-- ## Ball Handling -->
<h2 id="offensive-playmaking-and-scoring">Offensive Playmaking and Scoring</h2>
<p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#NBAPlayType"></a></span> tracks the following play types: transition, isolation,
pick &amp; roll ball handler, pick &amp; roll roll man, post up, spot up, handoff, cut,
off screen and putbacks.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>At least these categories provide a baseline for what search terms to use.
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#NBAPlayType"></a></span> also has a miscellaneous play type section, so it&rsquo;ll be
interesting to see if a new play-type pops up in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h3 id="offensive-moves">Offensive Moves</h3>
<p>Resources: <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#FIBACMOffensiveMoves"></a></span></p>
<p>The first step should be quick, explosive and in the direction that you wish to
go. Many players' first step goes nowhere or moves them in the opposite
direction, and this is typically because of not being in a low and balanced
stance.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Before I learned the art, a <del>punch</del> first step was just a <del>punch</del> first step
<del>, and a kick, just a kick</del>. After I learned the art, a <del>punch</del> first step
was no longer a <del>punch</del> first step <del>, a kick, no longer a kick</del>. Now that I
understand the art, a <del>punch</del> first step is just a <del>punch</del> first step <del>and
a kick is just a kick</del>. The height of cultivation is really nothing special. It
is merely simplicity; the ability to express the utmost with the minimum.</p>

<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Motion offense is pretty common in pickup games. Learning the principles behind
it should help me read the floor better and shoot high-percentage shots.</p>
<p>The meta seems to be a 5-out offensive setup, where players occasionally cut to
the basket.</p>
</div>
</div>

</figure>

<p>Notice how the movement involve some initial cut into a threatening position,
and not just a straight line. In general straight line cuts make sense when your
defender has their back to you and therefore can&rsquo;t see you.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I remember reading somewhere that change in pace is also potent. I frequently
make the mistake of only focusing on raw pace, which tires me out fast.</p>

<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#FIBACMOffensiveMovement"></a></span> says, &ldquo;Initially, motion offence emphasizes
the movement of players, with players needing to be able to play in all
positions on the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why the word &ldquo;initially&rdquo;? At what point does motion offence no longer need
movement and ability to play in all positions?</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>As a dribbler: go at your defender&rsquo;s hip; be a scorer first; get both feet in
the paint; jump stop; shot/foot fake to create penetration opportunities.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>The &ldquo;jump stop&rdquo; part surprised me. Maybe that&rsquo;s because if I keep dribbling in
the key, then the ball will get stolen?</p>

<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Had limited success in P&amp;R ball handler plays today. Coach always used to tell
me to brush the shoulder of the screener. I don&rsquo;t remember doing that, so maybe
that&rsquo;s why the P&amp;R ball handler plays were ineffective. Luckily, we had a lights
out 3pt shooter.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Options: penetrate the paint ready to shoot/pass; split between the two
defenders; shoot a runner; step-back if on-ball defender goes under the screen.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>&ldquo;Dribble&rdquo; is conspicuously missing. Dribbling in the paint will probably lead
to a turnover.</p>

<p>Tip: drive hard to create separation.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Hard drives prompt the defender to commit, which frees up other options.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Often, a &ldquo;big&rdquo; sets the screen for the ball-handling guard.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Creates a room for mismatches that can be exploited. Furthermore, if the big is
not involved, then the paint will probably be too crowded.</p>
</div>
</div>





<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>A common mistake I make is always going for a hard drive after a screen. I&rsquo;m
not tall/athletic enough to finish at the rim against a big. Furthermore, if the
big is coming for me, then my big has a mismatch!</p>

### Fast Break Offense

The objective is to get a basket before the defense gets their act together.

## Making Assists

--->
<h2 id="defense">Defense</h2>
<p>Compete every possession. Need to have a care factor. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Caruso2021"></a></span></p>
<p>Physical attributes, e.g. lateral movement. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Caruso2021"></a></span></p>
<p>Know what the opponent wants to do, e.g. do they tend to shoot off a left
dribble; where do they [actually] want to go. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Caruso2021"></a></span></p>
<p>Thinking costs you precious half-seconds, that make the difference between a
pass interception, and an open look from the opponent. Anticipate. Rondo and
LeBron are prime examples of this sort of awareness. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Caruso2021"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>This idea is not clear. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Caruso2021"></a></span> says that in his best defensive
games, he&rsquo;s not really thinking about anything - he&rsquo;s reacting like his mind and
body <em>knows</em> what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>But something mental is going on. Maybe on a subconscious level, i.e. &ldquo;thinking
without thinking&rdquo;?</p>
