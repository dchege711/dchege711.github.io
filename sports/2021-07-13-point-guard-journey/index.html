go. Many players' first step goes nowhere or moves them in the opposite
direction, and this is typically because of not being in a low and balanced
stance.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Before I learned the art, a <del>punch</del> first step was just a <del>punch</del> first step
<del>, and a kick, just a kick</del>. After I learned the art, a <del>punch</del> first step

the defender to change their momentum (and thus out of position). <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Ayers2018KyrieFinishing></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Think of all of those times when as a defender, you felt you could have blocked
or altered the shot if only you were in a position to challenge it. Coach used
to always talk about split-second decisions. Noticing a change in your defenders
momentum and reacting to it is too small a window for you to start thinking
about it.</p></div></div><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>A fellow player showed me a dribble move that he attributes to James Harden. I
don&rsquo;t know its canonical name, which makes it hard to get a tutorial. The gist
is:</p><ul><li>Dribble with the left</li><li>As you cross over the ball to the right<ul><li>Take a step with your left foot.</li><li>Push off the left foot.</li></ul></li><li>Ball gets to your right hand, and you have momentum from the left-foot
push-off.</li></ul></div></div><p>There are a couple of gathers available: euro step to evade a defender, jump
stop for pivoting/shooting options, pro-hop (euro step + jump stop, with a rip
of the ball to the opposite side of the body), pro-hop euro step (pro-hop + euro
step - jump stop), two-feet takeoff (more balance, power, and control of jump
direction esp. to avoid shot blockers <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Ayers2018KyrieFinishing></a></span>), and
over-the-head (getting past a defender while protecting the ball). <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiBballMoves></a></span></p><p>Show the ball to the defender to get them out of position (e.g. show ball upward
to make the defender jump early), and then extend away (especially to do a
reverse layup where you can use the rim to shield the ball). In addition to
getting the defender to bite early, swinging the ball provides momentum to get
some spin on the ball. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Ayers2018KyrieFinishing></a></span></p><p>It&rsquo;s important to keep your eyes on the rim. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Ayers2018KyrieFinishing></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>How are you going to see potential dishes? Granted, I typically don&rsquo;t see Kyrie
dishing out on his layups.</p><p>This might also be helpful as a defender. If the player I&rsquo;m guarding has their
eye on the rim, then playing on-ball makes more sense. If they&rsquo;re looking
elsewhere, then I might be able to deflect a potential dish.</p><p>But again, the rim is a constant. Won&rsquo;t it provide a greater advantage to note
your relative position to the rim, and then observe the defense&rsquo;s reaction? Or
is this sort of observation best reserved for peripheral vision?</p></div></div><p>Use your momentum wisely depending on defender&rsquo;s position. Bump them such that
they can&rsquo;t jump and block you. If you&rsquo;re slightly ahead, try slowing down a
bit to create this contact. If they&rsquo;re slightly ahead, use a delayed step to get
them to move past you. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Ayers2018KyrieFinishing></a></span></p><p>Finish off your off-foot to throw off the defenders' timing. Especially helps if
you can finish with your off-hand (including floaters). Often, you don&rsquo;t need to
jump upwards; you need to beat the defender to the glass. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Ayers2018KyrieFinishing></a></span></p><h3 id=offensive-tactics-and-strategies>Offensive Tactics and Strategies</h3><h4 id=offensive-movement>Offensive Movement</h4><p>Resources: <span class=citation-ref><a href=#FIBACMOffensiveMovement></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Motion offense is pretty common in pickup games. Learning the principles behind
it should help me read the floor better and shoot high-percentage shots.</p><p>The meta seems to be a 5-out offensive setup, where players occasionally cut to
the basket.</p></div></div><figure><img src=/img/sports/pg-journey/motion-offence-5-out-replacing-the-cutter.jpg alt="Motion Offence - 5 Out - Replacing the Cutter.

Credits: FIBA Coaches Manual 2.1.2</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how the movement involve some initial cut into a threatening position,
and not just a straight line. In general straight line cuts make sense when your
defender has their back to you and therefore can&rsquo;t see you.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I remember reading somewhere that change in pace is also potent. I frequently
make the mistake of only focusing on raw pace, which tires me out fast.</p></div></div><figure><img src=/img/sports/pg-journey/motion-offence-5-out-ball-reversal.jpg alt="Motion Offence - 5 Out - Ball Reversal.

the movement of players, with players needing to be able to play in all
positions on the court.&rdquo;</p><p>Why the word &ldquo;initially&rdquo;? At what point does motion offence no longer need
movement and ability to play in all positions?</p></div></div><p>As a dribbler: go at your defender&rsquo;s hip; be a scorer first; get both feet in
the paint; jump stop; shot/foot fake to create penetration opportunities.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The &ldquo;jump stop&rdquo; part surprised me. Maybe that&rsquo;s because if I keep dribbling in
the key, then the ball will get stolen?</p></div></div><figure><img src=/img/sports/pg-journey/motion-offence-5-out-dribble-penetration-receivers-principles.jpg alt="Motion Offence - 5 Out - Dribble Penetration - Receivers' Principles.

that&rsquo;s why the P&R ball handler plays were ineffective. Luckily, we had a lights
out 3pt shooter.</p></div></div><p>Options: penetrate the paint ready to shoot/pass; split between the two
