Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &amp;ldquo;10,000 hours rule&amp;rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts.
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.
A cross-sectional study is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population (or a representative subset) at a specific point in time.</description></item><item><title>The Gene-Free Model of Expertise</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/sports/epstein-sports-gene/01-gene-free-model-of-expertise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/sports/epstein-sports-gene/01-gene-free-model-of-expertise/</guid><description>Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.
Superior Perception Athletes outperformed novices when asked if there was a ball in a rapidly flashed slide.</description></item></channel></rss>
