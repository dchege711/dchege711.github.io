<p>Teens need their sleep: sleep-deprived teens are at increased risk for poor academic performance, binge drinking, and suicide.</p>
<p>BPS laid out the algorithm’s four guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the number of high school students starting school after 8am</li>
<li>Decrease the number of elementary school students dismissed after 4pm</li>
<li>Accommodate the needs of special education students wherever possible</li>
<li>Generate transportation savings that could be reinvested in the schools</li>
</ul>
<p>Officials picked a solution that attempted to balance several goals — student health, cost savings, and parental happiness.</p>
<p>But no one anticipated the opposition. Angry parents signed an online petition and filled the school committee chamber. The city summarily dropped it.</p>
<p>Pushing high school start times back requires pushing elementary and middle schools into earlier time slots, some elementary schools by as much as two hours.</p>
<p>The algorithm promised racial equity - distributing the best school start times more evenly across white, black, and brown neighborhoods. And here were the most active, politically connected families in the city trying to spike it.</p>
<p>Even if the algorithm promised to reduce inequities, the upheaval involved — with nearly 85% of the district getting new start times — would hit black and brown families especially hard. Parents of color are disproportionately likely to have lower-wage jobs that will make it harder for them to change schedules to meet the new demands of BPS, let alone pay more money for additional child care after school</p>
<p>It was people who made the final call. This was a fundamentally human conflict, and all the computing power in the world couldn’t solve it.</p>
