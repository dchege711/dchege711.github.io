      <description>OCR tends to miss (sometimes) really important context.
Make use of derived data, e.g. age at marriage, gender differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names
Don&#39;t spend all your time cleaning data.
Try a sequence of things, not one big idea.
Don&#39;t expect existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not as straightforward.
