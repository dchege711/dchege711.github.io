      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94% [] Google Directions API limited their free tier. CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&#39;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>

      <description>Open Source Doesn’t Make Money Because It Isn’t Designed To Make Money.  Ian Bicking. http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2019/03/open-source-doesnt-make-money-by-design.html. Mar 18, 2019.  A [fallacious] Just World hypothesis: if something has utility, if it helps people, if it’s something the world needs, if it empowers other people, then there should be a revenue opportunity.
Classical scratch-your-own-itch open source software is built by programmers for programmers. And it is wildly successful, but it’s selling to people who aren’t willing to pay.</description>

      <description>OCR tends to miss (sometimes) really important context.
Make use of derived data, e.g. age at marriage, gender differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names
Don&#39;t spend all your time cleaning data.
Try a sequence of things, not one big idea.
Don&#39;t expect existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not as straightforward.
