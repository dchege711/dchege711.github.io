<p>I don’t know much about physics but constantly reference Galileo despite knowing little besides the fact that he dared challenge the church.</p>

<p>Masayoshi Son turned $20m into Alibaba into $100b. But he's mistaking luck in VC for his superior intuition. Why invest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/business/softbank-wag.html">$300m in a dog-walking app</a>?</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I wonder how that deal went through. What in heaven was in their pitch deck? But I heard rumors that America pampers dogs more than children, so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>Not recognizing your blessings feeds into the dark side of capitalism and meritocracy: the notion that success is a choice, and that those who haven’t achieved success are not unlucky, but unworthy.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I'm relatively lucky. I don't know how much of the techie hubris that I bear. I have unresolved feelings about meritocracy and fairness. Race is usually used as a proxy for bridging the gap, e.g. affirmative action at colleges. But who is affirmative action better suited for - a rich black kid or a poor white kid? I'm in the camp that believes wealth is a bigger divider than race.</p>

<p>​I was skeptical of VC firms <em>for</em> PoC, but this chart is alarming. I wonder how skewed the numbers would be if viewed by parental income. How would one even get such data?</p>

<p>Dartmouth &lsquo;13, Princeton &lsquo;13, Yale &lsquo;13, Penn &lsquo;13, and Brown &lsquo;13 had more students from the top 1% of the income scale than the bottom 60%.</p>

<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>The sectors that have enjoyed the greatest prosperity spread across increasingly few people — technology and finance — have created an unprecedented level of arrogance among people born on third base.</p>
<p>When we feel threatened, we are more prone to see each other as an enemy, rather than someone who has a different opinion. We want to dismiss and fight the whole person, rather than just what they said.</p>
<p>The rich are more generous in times of lesser inequality and less generous when inequality grows more extreme <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-are-rich-people-so-mean/">[wired.com, PAYWALL] Why Are Rich People So Mean?</a>.</p>
