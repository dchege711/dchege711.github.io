      <description>The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)

      <description>Investing through Groups (Chamas) www.kaig.org has developed a Chama Handbook to boost accountability and profitability.
But chamas have a higher chance of being guided by friendships than profitability. For instance, how do I go about picking a chama? It&#39;s most likely a referral from a friend who&#39;s already in a chama.

      <description> etfdb.com has ETFs tracking regions. Surprised that Kenya isn&#39;t on it. And they&#39;re all losing money - best (over 5 years) is SA at -14.59%, Nigeria is at -64%.   Why all the PR on Africa being the next big investment scene?  Of course, Kenya&#39;s the premier investment destination (invest.go.ke)   Am I reading this right?? SOXL (semiconductors) ETF has &amp;gt;700% return over 5 years etfdb.com    </description>
