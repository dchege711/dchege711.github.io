    <h2 id="the-tulip-bulb-craze">The Tulip Bulb Craze</h2>
<p>Virus causes colored stripes in tulip petals. The Dutch valued such bulbs. Prices rose (just when one thought they couldn't go higher). Let the tulipmania begin.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Note: And that's where FOMO comes in. You can't argue with the results. You just want to dip your toes and get out. I watched Bitcoin keep climbing, until I got into the game with $50&hellip;</p>

<p>Tulip bulbs options. 20 for a bulb currently worth 100. If the price moved to 200, the option holder exercises his right: buys at 100 and simultaneously sells at 200, making a profit of 80.</p>
<p>Prices eventually got so high that some people decided they would be prudent and sell their bulbs. Soon others followed suit, and then others&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-south-sea-bubble">The South Sea Bubble</h2>
<p>Long prosperous period led to fat savings and thin investment outlets. The South Sea Company rose as an investment vehicle. It was given a monopoly over all trade in the South Seas.</p>
<p>The South Sea Company was England's answer to the French Missisipi Company (aimed to introduce paper currency; investors flocked). There'll be peace with Spain. We'll finance the national debt. Stocks payment plan: we'll lend you £££ - 10% now and not another payment for a year.</p>
<p>The public bought up anything: importing jackasses from Spain; making saltwater fresh, building ships against pirates; encouraging the breeding of horses in England; trading in human hair; building hospitals for bastard children; extracting silver from lead; extracting sunlight from cucumbers; producing a wheel of perpetual motion.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>1720 was a crazy year. A company whose description was &ldquo;a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is&rdquo; also went public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sea_Company#Top_reached">(en.wikipedia.org)</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aug 1720, price reaches £1,000: insiders cash out; investor panic sales; stock falls to £100. Isaac Newton, a victim, is reported to have admitted, &ldquo;I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.&rdquo;</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Isaac Newton is a funny character. Yeah, calculus and physics. But alchemy and speculation too? Only the winners write history.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="wall-street-lays-an-egg">Wall Street Lays an Egg</h2>
<p>Pool managers had relationships with specialists to know the extent of pending buy/sell orders. Together, the pool managers generated trade events that made tick watchers want in on the action.</p>
<p>Pool managers made tipsheet writers and market commentators tell of coming exciting developments.</p>
<p>Once the public flooded in to buy, the pool did the selling.</p>
