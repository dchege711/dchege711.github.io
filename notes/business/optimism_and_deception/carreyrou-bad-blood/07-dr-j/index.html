            <p>June 2010 - Jan 2011: FB's private valuation doubles to $50b. &ldquo;Angry Birds&rdquo; dramatic App Store sales. Interest rates were ~zero, making hedge funds consider private startups.</p>
<h2 id="walgreens">Walgreens</h2>
<p>Dr. J - Walgreens Innovation. Theranos machines could open up a big new revenue stream. Walgreens agrees to prepurchase $50m of Theranos cartridges and loan Theranos $25m. Gets Walgreens CFO to fast track deal.</p>
<p>Commercially ready lab; devices can do 192 blood tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half of those tests couldn't be done with Edison's chemiluminescent immunoassays.</li>
<li>Theranos never showed the lab nor sent the results of the vitamin D test!</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll perform laboratory-developed tests (less regulated):</p>
<ul>
<li>Theranos unwilling to a 50-patient trial with Stanford Hospital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theranos's system had been comprehensively validated over the last 7 years by 10/15 largest pharma companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one in the pharma companies could verify Theranos&rsquo; claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Johns Hopkins University's Medical School had reviewed Theranos's tech:</p>
<ul>
<li>JHU's letter had a disclaimer that it doesn't signify an endorsement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Walgreens: <em>we can't risk a scenario where CVS has a deal with them in 6 months and it ends up being real.</em></p>

    <div class="comment"><p>It's interesting that these concerns were raised within Walgreen by junior employees. FOMO is one helluva drug.</p>

<p>Safeway was also in the loop. Burd, CEO, wanted to cut medical costs, while Renda, EVP, could relate since her husband had daily blood draws battling lung cancer.</p>
<p>Safeway agreed to loan Theranos $30m and redesign stores to accomodate Theranos clinics. Safeway would have exclusivity in supermarkets, while Walgreens would have it in drugstores.</p>
