            <p>David Boies led the pack.</p>
<p>Tyler is a young and unqualified. Many of your sources are disgruntled ex-employees who are equally unreliable. We do not consent to your publication of our trade secrets. [Well, we do not consent to waiving our journalistic privileges].</p>
<p>Delegation acknowledged ownership of commercial blood analyzers, but for comparison purposes only. Of the Siemens ADVIA and special dilution on the ADVIA, the delegation invoked trade secrets. On how many tests the Edison did: trade secret!</p>
<p>Delegation: the potassium test had had issues, but they had been resolved and no faulty results had been released to patients.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's coauthored paper? Outdated.</p>
<p>Erika received a letter demanding an interview with Boies Schiller attorneys to avoid her own litigation. Dr. Sundene had declined a meeting with Sunny and the response was hostile.</p>
<p>Boies sent WSJ a 2nd letter explicitly threatening a lawsuit. Boies had signed statements that Carreyrou had mischaracterized Sr. Beardsley's and Dr. Rezaie's statements and hadn't made it clear that they'll be used in a published article. Carreyrou didn't plan on using the information for it was secondhand. He was more worried that witnesses were caving in.</p>
<p>Dr Stewart had resisted Balwani's pressure to sign a statement, and Balwani threatened to besmirch her if the article went through. Despite it being an empty threat, she was trembling.</p>
