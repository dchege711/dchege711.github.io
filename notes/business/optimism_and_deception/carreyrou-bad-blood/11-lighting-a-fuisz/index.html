            <p>Elizabeth sued Richard Fuisz claiming he used Joe &amp; John Fuisz to steal confidential information at McDermott Will &amp; Emery, in order to build the rival patent. Note that John thought his father, Richard, was overbearing.</p>
<p>David Boies was legendary: antitrust against MSFT, Al Gore on contested 2000 election, overturning ban on gay marriage in CA. He also intimidated opponents with private investigators.</p>
<p>There was paranoia that Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America were thirsty for Theranos's blood. They suspected Richard was in league with Quest and LabCorp.</p>
<p>John was angry. His own practice (after leaving McDermott) was losing clients because of the Theranos case. His wife was having pregnancy complications.</p>
<p>At the deposition, John lashed out at Elizabeth, promising to fuck with her until she dies.</p>
<p>$150k/month in legal fees was weighing down the Fuiszs.</p>
<p>Theranos paid Boies's firm 300k shares at $15, i.e. $4.5m for the year. Boies had a vested financial interest in Theranos.</p>
<p>Fuisz noticed that Ian Gibbons appeared as co-inventor in many of the patents. Some patents resembled those that Gibbons had previously done at Biotrack. However, Boies attorneys kept pushing off Gibbon's deposition.</p>
