      <description>The Shady Economics of Buy-One-Get-One Free Deals. Zachary Crockett. The Hustle. https://thehustle.co/are-buy-one-get-one-free-deals-worth-it/. 2019-02-17.  BOGO goods are usually low-demand, non-efficient, lacking in quality and/or close to the expiration date. The BOGO deal is usually a 50% discount off of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). And oftentimes, this price is artificially marked up to begin with.
 MyPillow offered BOGO deal on their pillows, but really just doubled the price of the first pillow.</description>

      <description>Kobayashi Maru. Epsilon Theory. https://www.epsilontheory.com/kobayashi-maru/. 2019-01-29.  Environmental, Social and Governance Investing. So general as to be meaningless: marketing BS (thinking &amp;lsquo;holistically&amp;rsquo; about ESG risk factors as part of the investment process) to impact investing (providing wholesale financing for community lending initiatives).
ESG! The meme is about selling portfolios as virtue signaling devices. It moves the conversation away from fees and performance to values. Don&#39;t you want to make a difference?</description>

      <description>How Doctors Die. Zocalo Public Square. https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/ideas/nexus/.  Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &amp;lsquo;do everything&amp;rsquo;, but often they mean &amp;lsquo;do everything that’s reasonable.&amp;rsquo; But they may not know what’s reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish.</description>

      <description>The Submarine. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html. 2005-04.  Many people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come.</description>
