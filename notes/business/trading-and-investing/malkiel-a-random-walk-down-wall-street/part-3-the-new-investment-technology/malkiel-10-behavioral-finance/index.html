        <article id="main-article">
            <p>Behavioralists believe that investors are not rational in present and future valuations of securities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are substantial barriers to efficient arbitrage (selling overpriced securities short and buying underpriced ones).</p>
<h2 id="the-irrational-behavior-of-individual-investors">The Irrational Behavior of Individual Investors</h2>
<h3 id="overconfidence">Overconfidence</h3>
<p>Example: in a survey, 94% of male respondents believed that their athleticism was above average.</p>
<p>Hindsight bias makes the world seem predictable. Investors might think they can beat the market.</p>
<p>The tendency of &ldquo;growth&rdquo; stocks to underperform &ldquo;value&rdquo; stocks shows how overoptimistic growth forecasts are.</p>
<h3 id="biased-judgments">Biased Judgments</h3>
<p>People think that \( HTHTHTHTHT \) is a more random outcome than \( HHHHHTTTTT \). Investors may see trends that don't actually exist.</p>
<p>If Jane was an activist in her early years, people think <em>&lsquo;Jane is a banker and a feminist&rsquo;</em> more likely than <em>&lsquo;Jane is a banker&rsquo;</em>, despite the law that \( \mathbb{P}(A \cap B) \le \mathbb{P}(A)\). People tend to misuse similarity as a proxy for probabilistic thinking.</p>
<p>People discount Bayes&rsquo; Law. For instance, if they see someone who looks like a criminal, they fail to consider the low % of people that are criminals. Rare events get unnecessarily amplified.</p>
<h3 id="herding">Herding</h3>
<p>Groups make better decisions only if more information is shared and differing points of view are considered.</p>
<p>Investors have been observed to purchase stocks only because prices were rising. Charles Kindleberger: <em>There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.</em></p>
<p>Hong, Kubik and Stein found that mutual-fund managers are more likely to hold similar stocks if other managers in the same city were holding similar portfolios.</p>
<p>The average investor underperforms the stock market in the long run because they buy at peaks.</p>
<h3 id="loss-aversion">Loss Aversion</h3>
<p>Kahneman and Tversky found that to make people accept a fair coin flipping bet, the subject (on average) had to win $250 or lose $100. Therefore, losses are about 2.5x more painful than wins are desirable.</p>
<p>Kahneman and Tversky also discovered a &ldquo;framing&rdquo; effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program A will save 200. Program B has a one-third probability of saving everyone, otherwise no one will be saved.</li>
<li>Program A will kill 400. Program B has a one-third probability that no one dies, and two-thirds probability that everyone dies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In scenario 1, two-thirds of the people picked Program A as more desirable. In scenario 2, 75% chose Program B.</p>
<h3 id="pride-and-regret">Pride and Regret</h3>
<p>Investors sell a stock that has risen in order to realize profits and build self-esteem. This incurs capital gains tax.</p>
<p>Investors hold losing stocks to avoid realizing regret and loss. They miss out on tax deductions.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-finance-and-savings">Behavioral Finance and Savings</h2>
<p>Making employees have to opt out of 401(k) plans increases participation rates. People procrastinate a lot and have a status quo bias.</p>
<p>People view retirement contributions as a loss of current spending availability. Thaler-Benartzi overcame this by making employees commit salary increases in advance to retirement savings.</p>
<h2 id="limits-to-arbitrage">Limits to Arbitrage</h2>
<p>The market may remain irrational longer than the arbitrageur can remain solvent.</p>
<p>Hedge funds, the natural arbitrageurs, were net buyers of the dotcom boom! They were in it for the greater fool.</p>
<p>Short selling may not be possible or may be severely constrained.</p>
<p>A close substitute for the overpriced security to offset the short may be hard to find.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-lessons-for-investors-from-behavioral-finance">What are the Lessons for Investors from Behavioral Finance?</h2>
<p><em>If you sit down at the table and can’t figure out who the sucker is, get up and leave because it’s you.</em></p>
<p>Avoid herd investing, e.g. gold in the early 80s, Japanese real estate and stocks in the late 80s, internet-related stocks in the late 90s, bitcoin in 2017, &hellip;</p>
<p>Avoid overtrading. All you get are transaction costs and more taxes due. If you do trade, sell losers, not winners.</p>
<p>Be wary of new issues. IPOs are historically a bad deal. Hot IPOs are usually snapped up by big institutional investors.</p>
<p>Distrust foolproof schemes. Madoff's genius was promising 10-12% per year, which seemed reasonable to most people. But recall that despite the US stock market averaging 9%, it was down 40% in some years.</p>
