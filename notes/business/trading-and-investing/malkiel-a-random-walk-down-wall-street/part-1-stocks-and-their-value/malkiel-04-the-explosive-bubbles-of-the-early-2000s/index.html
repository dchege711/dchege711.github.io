<p>Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Merill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney fueled tech stocks.</p>
<p>Analysts were the very public cheerleaders for the boom! Traditionally buy:sell ratings for stocks was 10:1; it was now 100:1.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Investment banks take a laissez faire approach to underwriting, e.g. *the public doesn't like dual-class stock, but we won't stop you - <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-01-17/snap-votes-and-banker-bonuses">Snap even sold zero-vote shares (bloomberg.com, 2017/01)</a>. Goldman used to require 3 years of profitability, but FOMO in the dotcom boom made them scrap that rule. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-24/goldman-won-t-underwrite-just-anyone">(bloomberg.com, 2020/01)</a></p>

<h3 id="new-valuation-metrics">New Valuation Metrics</h3>
<p>To value Internet companies, eyeballs (# visitors) and mind-share (% of online time in a given space) were used.</p>
<p>For telecom companies, length of fiber-optic cables in the ground (as opposed to the tiny % that had traffic) was used.</p>
<h3 id="the-writes-of-the-media">The Writes of the Media</h3>
<p>Investment magazines: Internet stocks likely to double in the months ahead.</p>
<p>CNBC and Bloomberg became cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>There were 10m Internet &ldquo;day traders&rdquo;, many of whom had quit their jobs. Most actually lost money even during the bubble.</p>
<h3 id="fraud-slithers-in-and-strangles-the-market">Fraud Slithers In and Strangles the Market</h3>
<p>Enron made complex partnerships that facilitated overstatement of Enron’s earnings, e.g. counting loans as profits.</p>
<p>Telecoms overstated revenues through swaps of fiber-optic capacity at inflated prices, and masqueraded expenses as revenue.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-have-known-the-dangers">Should We Have Known the Dangers?</h3>
<p>The key to investing is not how much an industry will affect society or even how much it will grow, but rather its ability to make and sustain profits.</p>
<h2 id="the-us-housing-bubble-and-crash-of-the-early-2000s">The US Housing Bubble and Crash of the Early 2000s</h2>
<h3 id="the-new-system-of-banking">The New System of Banking</h3>
<p>Old system: banks hold mortgage loans until they're repaid.</p>
<p>New system: banks make mortgage loans; holds them for a few days (low risk thus minimal due diligence); sells them to investment banker; i-banker issues bonds &ldquo;securitized&rdquo; by the interest and principal of underlying mortgages.</p>
<p>The mortgage-backed bonds were sliced into different tranches: AAA-bonds had first claims on payments from underlying mortgages. The &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; rating was used even when underlying mortage loans were low quality.</p>
<p>Credit-default swaps (2nd order derivatives!) were issued as insurance policies on the mortgage-backed bonds. Owning an underlying bond was not required to buy the swaps. Swaps traded to as much as 10x the underlying bonds&rsquo; value.</p>
<h3 id="looser-lending-standards">Looser Lending Standards</h3>
<p>No equity down for mortgage loans in the hopes that housing prices would rise forever.</p>
<p>Federal Housing Administration was directed to guarantee the mortgages of low-income borrowers.</p>
<h3 id="the-housing-bubble">The Housing Bubble</h3>
<p>Easy credit pushed up house prices rapidly. Positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>Home buyers discover mortage &raquo; home value; they start defaulting.</p>
<p>House prices drop. Mortgage-backed securities plummet.</p>
<h2 id="bubbles-and-economic-activity">Bubbles and Economic Activity</h2>
<p>It's not that the market is inefficient, but that it corrects itself slowly and inexorably.</p>
<p>Investment risk is never clearly perceived. The discount rate is never certain. Markets are not always or even usually correct, but no one consistently knows how.</p>

    <div class="comment"><p>I think I'm more knowledgeable than Malkiel in technical crypto matters. Let's see if he holds up.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The entire cryptocurrency market is relatively small, but the increase in prices was dramatic. 2017 BTC: $750 -&gt; $20,000 -&gt; $14,000.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-and-blockchain">Bitcoin and Blockchain</h3>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Malkiel oversimplifies stuff, e.g. <em>&ldquo;A coded and password-protected (but anonymous) entry on the ledger records ownership of the bitcoin.&quot;</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As long as the BTC does not fluctuate in value during the short period in which the transaction takes place, the dollar value does not matter.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Not really, if the reward BTC is not worth more than my mining costs, then I won't mine it. Or maybe I'll still mine it and hope that it appreciates in the future?</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jamie Dimon: BTC is a worthless fraud. Howard Marks and Buffet: Cryptocurrencies are not real and have no value.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I think he changed his mind later. On one hand, maybe you do have to be special to be JPMorgan's CEO, but on the other hand, corporate-speak and conflict of interest?</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="what-is-the-definition-of-money">What is the definition of money?</h3>
<ol>
<li>A Medium of exchange.</li>
<li>A unit of account to post prices and record debts now and in the future.</li>
<li>A store of value.</li>
</ol>
<p>BTC's extreme volatility makes it fail #2 and #3. At least for major currencies, there's a central bank that prevents volatility.</p>
<h3 id="should-the-bitcoin-phenomenon-be-called-a-bubble">Should the Bitcoin Phenomenon Be Called a Bubble?</h3>
<p>The blockchain technology is real, and could catch on.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>This is a common argument by the &lsquo;enlightened&rsquo; crowd. But blockchain looks like the &lsquo;dotcom&rsquo; of our day. Sometimes what companies need are (SQL) databases and access controls. The blockchain saga is for gullible investors.</p>
</div>

<p>Bubbles are propagated by popular culture: Pitbull, Katy Perry, Paris Hilton, Floyd Mayweather, Lionel Messi, Grey's Anatomy, Big Bang Theory, The Good Wife, The Simpsons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp&rdquo; =&gt; &ldquo;Long Blockchain Corp&rdquo;; stock surges 289%. Glance Technologies: buy weed&hellip; with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-make-the-bitcoin-bubble-deflate">What Can Make the Bitcoin Bubble Deflate?</h3>
<p>Governments can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ban usage of BTC, e.g. Roosevelt banned holding gold in 1933.</li>
<li>Shut down crypto exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p>If BTC &ldquo;whales&rdquo; decide to start cashing in.</p>
<p>If the encryption system gets broken.</p>

    <div class="comment"><p>At this point though, BTC would be the least of our problems.</p>
