<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Introduction</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page xvi &middot; Location 131</div><div class='noteText'>Since 1988, The Medallion Fund has averaged 66.1% returns before fees, accumulating +$104b in profits. Before 2000, the fee was 5/20. Since 2002, it has been 5/44.

Investor Key Fund/Vehicle Period Annualized Returns* Jim Simons Medallion Fund 1988–2018 39.1% George Soros Quantum Fund 1969–2000 32%* Steven Cohen SAC 1992–2003 30% Peter Lynch Magellan Fund 1977–1990 29% Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway 1965–2018 20.5%* Ray Dalio Pure Alpha 1991–2018 12%

The Medallion Fund is for inside investors only.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page xvii &middot; Location 135</div><div class='noteText'>RenTech has ~300 employees, and their trading profits in 2018 was $7.6b. Simmons is worth $23b. The average RenTech employee has $50m in the firm's own hedge funds.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page xviii &middot; Location 157</div><div class='noteText'>Simons subsidizes salaries of public school math/science teachers, funds autism research and origins of life research. Robert Mercer was Trump's biggest donor, brought in Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, and campaigned for Brexit.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Prologue</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 2 &middot; Location 201</div><div class='noteText'>Fall 1990. Simons had spent 12 years searching for a successful investing formula. In 1989, his net returns were -4.0%. In 1988, he had netted 9.0%. In 1990, he netted 55.0% (77.8% before fees).</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 2 &middot; Location 205</div><div class='noteText'>With Elywn Berlekamp, game theorist professor at UCB, Simons built a model for selecting idea trades based on data.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 3 &middot; Location 224</div><div class='noteText'>Berlekamp knew their approach was alchemic - no cash flows, interest rate forecasts, product research. Some of the trade recommendations didn't make sense.

Simons believed the system could be tuned to give 80%. Berlekamp was incredulous and quit due to Simon's incessant nagging.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 6 &middot; Location 258</div><div class='noteText'>Simons firmly believed that there are patterns in the market and they can be found.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part One: Money Isn’t Everything</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter One &gt; Page 10 &middot; Location 282</div><div class='noteText'>Simon's Mum: Tiger-Mum tendencies, smart but gullible.

Simon's Dad: vocational, never completed high school.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter One &gt; Page 12 &middot; Location 308</div><div class='noteText'>Young Jimmy: Independently arrived at Zeno's Paradox, and concluded that the family car should never need gas.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter One &gt; Page 15 &middot; Location 357</div><div class='noteText'>Simons was exceptional among his colleagues. But he could mull problems until he arrived at original solutions.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter One &gt; Page 19 &middot; Location 432</div><div class='noteText'>The gateway drug for Simons was soybeans futures that had couple grand of profits, but the prices tumbled and Simons barely broke even.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter One &gt; Page 20 &middot; Location 446</div><div class='noteText'>Simons explaining holonomy to a novice: the parallel transport of tangent vectors around closed curves in multiple-dimensional curved spaces.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 24 &middot; Location 490</div><div class='noteText'>At IDA, Simons developed a fast code-breaking algorithm for a long-standing problem. However, because this work was confidential, he couldn't share accomplishments with outsiders.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 27 &middot; Location 542</div><div class='noteText'>A soap film stretching across a wire frame has minimal area. Plateau's Problem: Do such minimal areas always exist and are they always so smooth no matter the wireframe? In 1930, 'Yes' was proved for 2D. Almgren, PU Prof, proved it for 3D. Simons extended this to 6D and formed a counter-example in 7D.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 29 &middot; Location 568</div><div class='noteText'>Simons and Crew relied on a hidden Markov model theory. The market has (8) underlying states, e.g. &quot;high variance&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, etc. By determining the most likely states, one could make appropriate bets - the 'why' didn't matter.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 30 &middot; Location 584</div><div class='noteText'>Other notables that were trying to solve the market: Harry Markowitz (Modern Portfolio Theory), Edward Thorp.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 32 &middot; Location 623</div><div class='noteText'>The Vietnam War put criticism on the IDA. Simons publicly disavowed the war. He was let go. Opportunely, SUNY Stony Brook had spent 5 years looking for someone to revitalize its Math Dept. Simons was recommended to the College President, and accepted the job. There, he honed a skill for recruiting talented math minds.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 699</div><div class='noteText'>Barbara felt stunted - she had married at 18 and had a kid at 19. They divorced. She went to UCB, completed CS PhD, did research at IBM, headed ACM and became a national expert on computerized voting.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 709</div><div class='noteText'>Simons contributed to quantifying shapes in curved 3D spaces. Chern extended it to all dimensions. The Chern-Simons theory won accolades and found applications in condensed matter, string theory and supergravity.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 39 &middot; Location 725</div><div class='noteText'>Freifeld built econometrics models to forecast commodity prices. Although they made money, Mayer remarked that there was no socially redeeming value in it.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Two &gt; Page 40 &middot; Location 744</div><div class='noteText'>In 1977, world currencies had begun to float (no longer pegged to the price of gold). Recognizing the volatile era, Simons eventually left academia to focus on currency trading.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 45 &middot; Location 798</div><div class='noteText'>At IDA, Simons built models to spot signals in the noise of comms of US enemies. At Stony Brook, he courted and managed talented mathematicians. Now, he'd hire their brains to develop formulas to profit from market data.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 47 &middot; Location 825</div><div class='noteText'>A hidden Markov process is one in which the results of the chain are visible, but not the states that help explain the progression of the chain. Like receiving the number of runs scored in each inning without knowing anything about baseball.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 47 &middot; Location 829</div><div class='noteText'>The Baum-Welch algorithm could estimate probabilities and parameters using a little more information than the results of the hidden Markov chain.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 51 &middot; Location 889</div><div class='noteText'>Baum, hesitant at first, joined Simmons and applied his knowledge to trade currencies. Ax (recruited at Stony Brook) extended the models to commodities. Monemetrics was making bank!</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 55 &middot; Location 946</div><div class='noteText'>Simons hired Hullender to program the computers. Hullender was being kicked out of Cal Tech for an unauthorized high-stakes trading operation out of his dorm room.

With Hullender, Simons could make a pure system that was free of human interference.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 57 &middot; Location 974</div><div class='noteText'>Simons collected data from the World Bank on commodity, bond and currency prices going back to decades. He had a staffer painstakingly write down interest rate histories from the Federal Reserve office. The closing prices of major currencies was noted down.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 58 &middot; Location 993</div><div class='noteText'>Named the &quot;Piggy Basket&quot;, the system mainly used momentum strategies, with a bit of correlation tests. It had $1m. The Piggy Basket made recommendations, while humans executed the trades - it was the best they could do.

Piggy Basket made bank for a few months. It then developed an appetite for potatoes, making Monemetrics almost corner the global potato market. Regulators closed down the positions, costing Monemetrics. Simons and Baum lost confidence in Piggy Basket.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 59 &middot; Location 1014</div><div class='noteText'>Simons and Baum switched to identifying undervalued investments while reacting to market news. They even hired a French Stony Brook student to translate an obscure French financial newsletter to get ahead.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 61 &middot; Location 1038</div><div class='noteText'>1982 -  Monemetrics becomes Renaissance Technologies Corporation. Simons had a thing for tech companies.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 62 &middot; Location 1061</div><div class='noteText'>Baum relied on intuition and instinct, and a buy-low-and-hold-forever theory. Baum racked up $43m in profits between July 1979 and March 1982 - ~2x his original stake from Simons.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 63 &middot; Location 1074</div><div class='noteText'>Baum's eternal optimism was a problem for Simons. In Fall 1979, they bought gold futures contracts at $250. Geopolitics jitters pushed gold and silver prices higher. People were queuing up to sell jewelry. Gold was at $800. Baum was sitting on more than $10m of profits. Simons thought a crash immenent. Simons forced Baum to bitterly sell. Gold went to $865, but came crashing to less than $500 a few months later.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Three &gt; Page 65 &middot; Location 1101</div><div class='noteText'>With inflation sort of under control and the feds predicting decline in interest rates, Baum purchased tens of millions of US bonds. Reagan issued a lot of bonds and the economy was growing rapidly - panic selling dominated. The Yen also stopped appreciating. Baum's positions were down 40%. At this point, Simons sold Baum's holdings and unwound trading affiliations as per their agreement. Ultimately, Baum proved prescient - interest rates and inflation tumbled, but Baum was already doing a solo shop at Princeton.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Four &gt; Page 72 &middot; Location 1212</div><div class='noteText'>Ax wasn't a likeable character. He got into a lot of arguments/fights. His personal life was in disarray. His early research wasn't original either - it was comparable to that of trenders.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Four &gt; Page 75 &middot; Location 1253</div><div class='noteText'>Straus was a data collector. The Telerate machines at trading floors didn't have an interface for investors to collect and analyze information (a laid-off Michael Bloomberg would later change that). Straus collected   tick data on commodities, futures and stocks. This was above and beyond what Straus was hired for.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Four &gt; Page 76 &middot; Location 1268</div><div class='noteText'>Straus foraged and cleaned data that the rest of the world cared little about. He looked for unusual spikes, dips and gaps.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter Four &gt; Page 78 &middot; Location 1302</div><div class='noteText'>Ax and Straus moved to the West Coast, forming Axcom. Simons received 25% of the profits and agreed to provide trading help and communicate with the new firm's clients.</h3>
