<p>Most people thought that it was impossible for a cell to learn. Maybe brains are not prerequisites for complex and interesting behavior.</p>
<p>If one part of the plasmodium touches something attractive, like food, it pulses more quickly and widens. If another part meets something repulsive, like light, it pulses more slowly and shrinks. By adding up all of these effects, the plasmodium flows in the best possible direction without a single conscious thought.</p>
<h2 id="better-than-engineers">Better than Engineers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A slime mold was released onto a Petri dish modeled on a map of the Greater Tokyo Area, with bits of food standing in for major urban centers.</li>
<li>After a day, it had created a network that was almost identical to Tokyo’s actual rail network.</li>
<li>This experiment was repeated with maps for the UK, Belgium, Mexico, Netherlands, Canada, Spain, China, Brazil and the US. The slime mold approximated almost all interstates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bridge-experiment-1">Bridge Experiment #1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slime molds can learn</li>
<li>To reach some food, they had to crawl over a bridge that was laced with repellents like salt or coffee.</li>
<li>At first, the molds were clearly repulsed, and were slow to ooze across.</li>
<li>With more repetitions, they became habituated; they got used to the chemicals, started ignoring them, and moved faster.</li>
<li>If they were given a long timeout, and then reintroduced them to the bridge, they were just as reluctant to cross as they originally were.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bridge-experiment-2">Bridge Experiment #2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slime molds can transfer what they’ve learned by merging with each other.</li>
<li>She brought naïve slime molds that had never encountered the repellent chemicals next to habituated ones that were already used to them.</li>
<li>The merged molds were quicker to cross the bridge than naïve individuals.</li>
<li>If the merged molds were re-separated, the formerly naïve ones still showed signs of habituation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The findings are sensationalized. In related news, ants, bees and soap film can also &lsquo;compute&rsquo; solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The network is nowhere near optimal. It ignores underground water, elevation differences, terrain types.</li>
<li>The network IRL was designed incrementally. If we could rebuild it from scratch, we could do better.</li>
<li>Slime mold can do one thing: spread greedily. Given all railroad stops, a greedy algorithm will get a good approximation.</li>
