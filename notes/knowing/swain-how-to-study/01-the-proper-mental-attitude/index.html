        <article id="main-article">
            <h2 id="distinguish-mere-facts-from-conclusions-or-opinions">Distinguish Mere Facts From Conclusions or Opinions</h2>
<p>Discriminate between mere statements of facts, necessary conclusions which follow therefrom, and mere opinions which they seem to render reasonable.</p>
<p>There's no need to perform an experiment to verify that the atomic weight of oxygen is 16.</p>
<p>That the sum of the angles of a plane triangle equals two right angles is not a mere fact, but an inevitable truth.</p>
<h2 id="investigate-the-reason-for-facts">Investigate the Reason For Facts</h2>
<p>Why would the wind in a storm in the northern hemisphere revolve counterclockwise around the storm's center?</p>
<p>Definitions are exempt. There is no reason why New York is 90 miles from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reasons require specialized knowledge that the student lacks, e.g. the laws of physics.</p>
<h2 id="if-theres-no-reason-for-the-facts-seek-to-know-how-they-ascertained">If There's No Reason for the Facts, Seek to Know How They Ascertained</h2>
<p>How do we ascertain that the sun is 92 million miles from the earth?</p>
<p>Suppose 3,072 Union soldiers were killed in the Battle of Gettysburg. Why 3,072 is not a reasonable question. But how did we arrive at 3,072?</p>
<h2 id="look-out-for-evidence-of-the-writers-reliability">Look Out for Evidence of the Writer's Reliability</h2>
<p>Faulty conclusions/opinions may result from illogical reasoning from correct facts, especially when it has to do with statistical results.</p>
<p>Be wary of overly dogmatic opinions and intolerability towards those that hold different conclusions.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-caution">Exercise Caution</h2>
<p>Read not to contradict and to confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider.</p>
<h2 id="an-open-mind-no-preconceived-ideas">An Open Mind; No Preconceived Ideas</h2>
<p>Clearly formulate a problem, gather all pertinent facts, and then draw the logical conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="be-intellectually-modest">Be Intellectually Modest</h2>
<p>Education will broaden a narrow mind, but there's no cure for a big head.</p>
<p>Not understanding what you know and what you don't know makes you overestimate your knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="study-to-gain-wisdom-rather-than-knowledge">Study to Gain Wisdom, Rather Than Knowledge</h2>
<p>Being knowledgeable is being full of the thoughts of other people.</p>
<p>Being wise involves being aware of your own thoughts in relation to your knowledge.</p>
