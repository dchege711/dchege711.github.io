<p>In real life, you have to gather evidence, which may be costly. At some point you have to decide that you have enough evidence to stop and choose. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the conclusion.</p>
<p>Suspect motivated stopping when you close off the search, after coming to a comfortable conclusion, and yet there is a lot of fast cheap evidence you haven't gathered yet.</p>
<p>Suspect motivated continuation when some evidence is leaning in a way that you don't like, but you decide that more (expensive) evidence is needed before you'll have to do anything uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as the hits don't keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in public opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a false theory no successes.</p>
<p>The problem with using binary qualitative reasoning is that any single observation either destroys the theory or it does not. When not even a single contrary observation is allowed, it creates a cognitive dissonance and has to be argued away.</p>
<p>Most court processes work on the theory that every case has exactly two opposed sides and that it is easier to find two biased humans than one unbiased one. Between the prosecution and the defense, someone has a motive to present any given piece of evidence, so the court will see all the evidence.</p>
<p>For every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of counter-evidence. You may find your belief drifting downward and further downward. Finally, there is no point in constructing excuses. You have already relinquished your cherished belief.</p>
<p>Rationality seeks more accuracy for our beliefs by changing them. Rationalization operates to fix beliefs already in place.</p>
<p>By rehearsing arguments that one already knew, one will erroneously double count your evidence such that it defeats an army of counter-evidence. Instead, rile up both sides and pit them in a fair fight.</p>
<p>Why would two rationalists mistakenly agree to disagree?</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncommon, but well-supported, scientific knowledge.</li>
<li>Long inferential distances.</li>
<li>Hard-to-verbalize intuitions, perhaps stemming from specific visualizations.</li>
<li>Patterns perceptually recognized from experience.</li>
<li>Emotional commitments to believing in a particular outcome.</li>
<li>Fear of a past mistake being disproven.</li>
<li>Deep self-deception for the sake of pride or other personal benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saying &lsquo;everything is interconnected because God made the whole world and sustains it&rsquo; may generate some nice warm and fuzzy feelings during the sermon, but I wouldn't want to be the forensic astronomer who had to look at the Moon and figure out whether the penny landed heads or tails.</p>
<p>By saying &ldquo;God did it!&rdquo; only when you've been blessed with a baby girl, and just-not-thinking &ldquo;God did it!&rdquo; for miscarriages and still births and crib deaths, you can build up quite a lopsided picture of God's benevolent personality. You don't even get to blurt &ldquo;God works in mysterious ways!&rdquo; or &ldquo;We're not wise enough to question God's decisions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Judaism has a tradition of inquiry. But you only attack targets for the purpose of defending them. You're allowed to doubt, but not to successfully doubt. &ldquo;Did they even have a word for &lsquo;billion&rsquo;? The seven-days story is a metaphor - first God created light, which represents the Big Bang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is true is already so.
Owning up to it doesn't make it any worse.
Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.</p>
<p>Once you tell a lie, the truth is your enemy; and every truth is connected to that truth, and every ally of the truth in general; all of those you must oppose, to protect the lie.</p>
