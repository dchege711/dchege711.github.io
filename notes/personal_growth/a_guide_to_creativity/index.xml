      <description>How to Read. Robert Heaton. https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17424652. 2018-06-25.   Know. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html. 2014-12-01.  Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort.
Information overload is one of my major obstacles to reading to know. There are so many pieces out there. I&#39;m biased towards highly upvoted HN submissions. My RSS feeds ran out of control a while back - my queue has +400 pending articles :-/</description>

      <description>The Age of the Essay. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html. Sept 2004.  An essay is something that you write to try and figure out something. By definition, you can&#39;t begin with a statement.
Expressing ideas helps you form them. Writing something that others might read forces you to think well.
Think of the essay as an idea graph. At each node, contrary to Geoffrey&#39;s Principle of Least Astonishment for UIs, branch out to the most interesting related idea.</description>
