      <description>Against Rationalization. Eliezer Yudkowsky. Rationality: From AI to Zombies. Feb 2015.  In real life, you have to gather evidence, which may be costly. At some point you have to decide that you have enough evidence to stop and choose. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the conclusion.
Suspect motivated stopping when you close off the search, after coming to a comfortable conclusion, and yet there is a lot of fast cheap evidence you haven&#39;t gathered yet.</description>
