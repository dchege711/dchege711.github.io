<h3 id="brian-skinner--how-to-distinguish-good-theory-from-crackpottery">Brian Skinner - how to distinguish good theory from crackpottery</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both theorists and crackpots share an irrational self-confidence</li>
<li>A crackpot relies primarily on positive evidence
<ul>
<li>Thinks hard about a problem, arrives at a theory that feels right, and then publicizes the result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A theorist incorporates negative evidence:
<ul>
<li>Ponders hard about a problem, arrives at a theory that feels right and then proceeds to try to disprove that theory</li>
<li>Takes time to understand competing theories and compare them against her own. If any disagree, she figures out why those theories are wrong.</li>
<li>Pushes her theory to the extremes, looks at its limiting cases and checks for disagreement w/ existing knowledge.</li>
<li>Only after her theory comes out unscathed does she publicize it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="teg-disagrees-with-skinners-emphasis-on-earnestly-trying-to-disprove-a-theory">TEG disagrees with Skinner's emphasis on earnestly trying to disprove a theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lots of junior colleagues spend far too long making sure they know everything in the given field before saying anything at all.</li>
<li>But an earnest well-thought out contribution to the conversation can be useful even if its wrong. Others can save themselves those months of time.</li>
<li>Dijkstra's maxim: If you can spend 20 minutes to save each of your readers 1 minute, then it is polite to do so if you expect at least 20 readers.</li>
<li>In fact, due to the Matthew Effect, a junior researcherâ€™s work is much less likely to be read and so they have less to fear from Dijkstra's maxim</li>
<li>Unfortunately as people become more senior and senior, they often release more half-baked ideas that are read by more and more colleagues.</li>
