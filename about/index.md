I'm Chege Gitau, a software developer.  I lived in Kenya till I joined Princeton University where I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working in the US as a software developer for Microsoft. My hobbies include basketball, video games, reading books & blogs and drinking plain milk.

I blog because it helps me improve my clarity, both in thought and in language. It also reminds me that I have something worth saying. I envision my posts taking the form of interesting questions. More often than not, my training as a computer scientist will avail tools to help me answer those questions.
