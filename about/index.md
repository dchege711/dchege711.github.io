I'm Chege Gitau. I was born and raised in Kenya. My hobbies include basketball, video games, reading books & blogs and drinking plain milk.

I blog because it helps me improve my clarity. It also reminds me that I have something worth saying. I envision my posts taking the form of interesting questions. More often than not, my training as a computer scientist will avail tools to help me answer those questions.
