      <description>Holmes had an all-star team: Larry Ellison&amp;rsquo;s mentor as Chair, Associate Dean of Stanford&amp;rsquo;s School of Engineering, 30 years IBM experience, 25 years pharma and biotech experience, Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s chip-making subsidiary head&amp;hellip;
Fraud or not, this is a sick lineup! How could she mess this up?
  Big Pharma spends tens of $B on clinical trials each year. Theranos would enable them to adjust dosage and save 30%. Holmes insisted on revising financial projections upward - assuming all (15+) deals came through - to $1.</description>

      <description>Quiz It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give pessimistic answers when the book&amp;rsquo;s title says &amp;ldquo;Things Are Better Than You Think&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
    In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?
üî≤‚ÄÖA: 20 percent
‚ùå‚ÄÖB: 40 percent
‚úÖ‚ÄÖC: 60 percent
There has been lots of efforts to get girls to finish primary school, e.g. providing sanitary towels. Surely, they must be at \( \ge 40% \) completion rates.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Tipping Point is the biography of how little things had big effects.
From 1992 to 1997, murder rates dropped 64.3% to 770 and total crimes fell by \(\approx\) 50% to 355,893.
Geometric progressions are non-intuitive, e.g. if given a large paper and asked to fold it 50x, the stack&amp;rsquo;s height will be \(\approx\) the distance to the sun.
This is a popular illustration. The standard paper&amp;rsquo;s thickness, \(h_0\), is \(0.</description>

      <description>You need to develop a broad spectrum of style and then be able to move from one end of the spectrum to the other as occasion demands. You&amp;rsquo;ll develop a basic style but inability to diversify is being like a baller with a drive but no jump shot. Questions to ask: What am I writing about? Who will read what I&amp;rsquo;ve written? Why did I write it?   I&amp;rsquo;m writing about topics that I want to know more about.</description>

      <description>The order of learning: the necessary, the useful, the ornamental.
A teacher&amp;rsquo;s duty is to show the student what he can do for themselves and how to do it.
Knowing how to study is especially important because college can only cover so much. Furthermore, a student&amp;rsquo;s career requirements may change.
Nothing is true simply because it is in a book. It must pass the test of one&amp;rsquo;s understanding. In case the understanding is beyond the student, they must perceive whether it&amp;rsquo;s mere fact, definition or opinion.</description>

      <description>To classify something, find things that are similar and label it with the same class as the most similar thing.
Fundamentals: Feature Space &amp;amp; Similarity Metrics The feature space is \(N-d\), where \(N\) is the number of features.
Each instance is mapped to a point. The descriptive features become the axes.
For example:
  Speed and agility ratings for college athletes and draft status. Source: JBA (ELE 364)
  The Similarity Metric Mathematically, it must conform to these 4 criteria:</description>

Young Jimmy independently arrived at Zeno&amp;rsquo;s Paradox, and concluded that the family car should never need gas.
Reminds me of an anecdote a friend told me about intern interviews for one of the big banks. Something like, if you keep moving half the distance, how many moves do you need to make in order to touch some object? The expected answer was impossible, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy it.</description>

      <description>Fall 1990. Simons had spent 12 years searching for a successful investing formula. In 1989, his net returns were -4.0%. In 1988, he had netted 9.0%. In 1990, he netted 55.0% (77.8% before fees).
With Elywn Berlekamp, game theorist professor at UCB, Simons built a model for selecting idea trades based on data.
Berlekamp knew their approach was alchemic - no cash flows, interest rate forecasts, product research. Some of the trade recommendations didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.</description>

Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&amp;rsquo;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>The access patterns for a data system (e.g. database, cache, etc.) motivate different implementations, and thus performance characteristics.
Because many applications have a wide range of requirements, single tools no longer meet all of the data processing and storage needs. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the application to stitch together different tools.
Despite the behind-the-scenes stitching, the data system may provide certain guarantees, e.g. the cache will be correctly invalidated.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;d think that at Signal&amp;rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon.</description>

      <description>Random walk: future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. Thus, short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable.
Investing as a Way of Life Today Difference between speculations and investments: time period and predictability of the return.
To stay even, your returns must match inflation (averaged 4% from 1962 to 2018).
With regard to beating inflation, that implies all the money that&amp;rsquo;s in people&amp;rsquo;s bank accounts is depreciating, as opposed to maintaining value.</description>

      <description>The goal is to make large datasets safe, i.e. no harm to you from having your data included.
Sanitize and Transfer Model Remove all PII, _e.g. name, SSN, mobile number, etc, before releasing the dataset.
However, the list of PII is not necessarily complete. Furthermore, combinations of seemingly non-PII data can be jointly identifying.
Using an auxilliary dataset is a common re-identification method, e.g. Narayanan and Shmatikov [2010]  combined IMDB ratings and comments to deanonymize a Netflix dataset.</description>

      <description>Holmes wanted to be a billionaire since childhood. Her parents were from wealth, with medical and military folk. Holmes attended Houston&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious private school. She spoke her way into Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Mandarin program, while still in high school. Parents insisted on living a purposeful life.
Worked in lab during school year. Freshman internship at Genome Institute of Singapore: nasal swabs and syringes. There had to be a better way.

      <description>Bernoulli Process A Bernoulli Process is a sequence of independent \({0, 1}\) - valued random variables \(X_1, X_2, X_3, &amp;hellip;\), e.g. \(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1\)
A Bernoulli Process does not mandate that the probability distributions of the \(X_i\) be identical. That is up to the model that we choose. For instance, the Binomial Random Variable assumes \(\mathbb{P}\{X_i = 1\} = p \ \ \forall i\)
  Suppose you flip a coin repeatedly, and record \(0\) for tails and \(1\) for heads.</description>

      <description>\(X\) is a binomial random variable if it takes the values \(0, 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, n\) and
$$ \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = { n \choose k } \cdot p^k \cdot (1 - p)^{n-k} $$
Sanity Check: Do the probabilities sum to 1? $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} { n \choose k } p^k (1 - p)^{n-k} = \left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n = 1 $$
I totally didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how we got to \(\left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n\).</description>

Revere goes out informing people. Churchbells and drums. Those informed by Revere send out riders of their own.
In Concord, the colonial militia soundly beat the British, kicking off the American Revolution.
Wiliam Dawes also had a ride. But the local militia leaders weren&amp;rsquo;t alerted. Few people came out to fight the British.</description>

  Make a prediction for the query equal to the value of the target feature of the nearest neighbor    The Voronoi Tessellation is a partition of the feature space such that each partition is the &amp;lsquo;adoptive-radius&amp;rsquo; of the instance that &amp;lsquo;owns&amp;rsquo; that partition.</description>

      <description>A fault is when a component deviates from its spec, while a failure is when the system no longer provides the required service to the user.
Better to design fault-tolerant systems because we can&amp;rsquo;t reduce the probability of a fault to zero.
In fault-tolerant systems, one should trigger faults deliberately in order to test the tolerance, e.g. randomly killing individual processes.
However, not all things can be tolerated. For instance, if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, then the damage can&amp;rsquo;t be undone.</description>

At the cost of being painful on the eyes. Python scripts are way more readable (and cross-platform) than shell scripts.

      <description>The Subject The number of words aren&amp;rsquo;t intuitive to me. Adults tend to read non-fiction at 238 words per minute. [] So a good test for how appropriate a piece of writing is, &amp;ldquo;Can the writer cover X in N minutes?&amp;rdquo;
Hugo uses 213 WPM, while Medium uses 265 WPM, suggesting Medium has a bias for skimming over close reading. []
I wonder if a browser extension that rates the appropriateness of articles given their subject and their word count is a feasible/desirable thing.</description>

      <description>More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.
Why is this cause of disaster so common?  Our estimation techniques assume that all will go well, i.e. each task will take only as long as it &amp;ldquo;ought&amp;rdquo; to take. Our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are interchangeable. Because we are uncertain of our estimates, software managers often lack the courteous stubbornness - if you&amp;rsquo;re made to wait, it is to serve you better, and to please you.</description>

      <description>Similarity-based learning is intuitive and gives people confidence in the model.
There is an inductive bias that instances that have similar descriptive features belong to the same class.
Remarkably so. When I think of classifying things, my mind immediately goes to NN.
  Similarity learning has a stationary assumption, i.e. the joint PDF of the data doesn&amp;rsquo;t change (new classifications do not come up). This assumption is shared by supervised ML.</description>

Universa, a hedge fund made to exploit black swans, made 3,612% in March 2020 amidst the coronavirus crisis. Taleb is an advisor on the fund. [] However, on a &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; day, Universa is always losing money.

      <description>Gathering evidence IRL may be expensive. When picking a stopping point, ask whether the collected evidence compels the conclusion, not whether it allows the conclusion.
Check your motivations. Are you ignoring fast cheap evidence because you already have a comfortable conclusion? Are you holding out for expensive slow evidence because the conclusion is uncomfortable?
A probabilistic model can take a few hits. But we sometimes assume a true theory can have no failures and a false theory can have no success.</description>

      <description>Majority Voting The \(k\) nearest neighbors model predicts the target level from the majority vote from the set of the \(k\) nearest neighbors to the query \(q\).
Where \(\delta\) is an indicator function such that \(\delta(t_i, l) = 1 \iff t_i = l\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k} (q) = argmax_{l \in levels(t)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \delta(t_i, l) \right) $$
For categorical features, \(k\) should be odd to avoid ties.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t read right. If there are 3 possible categories, \(k = 3\) can result in a tie.</description>

      <description>Beginnings Your shot at intriguing or acclimating the reader. Establish the tone, stylistic manner and attitude in the first few sentences.
The Direct Beginning State the subject in the first sentence, and the thesis in the first paragraph.
Use the first paragraph to define subject or a quick synopsis of the material to come.
The Delayed Beginning An attention-getting device, e.g. anecdote, generalization, vivid description, dramatic incident, paradoxical observation, can serve as the background to your thesis.</description>

      <description>Pick the best book. New to a subject? Start with the elementary one.
Study a few subjects at once, but not too many. The mind needs change of occupation, not idleness.
Weigh carefully before taking up or dropping a study. Read much but not many books.
Fix your mind intensely on one thing for a time long enough to make progress.
AKA &amp;ldquo;Deep Work&amp;rdquo;. The new old thing.
  Apply what you&amp;rsquo;re studying.</description>

So in a way, Elizabeth didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up in wealth? This puts a spin on Chapter 01: A Purposeful Life  .
  Fuisz was offended that Elizabeth never consulted him. Fuisz made his money patenting medical inventions that he anticipated other companies would someday want.</description>

      <description>When you have features taking different range if values, you may have odd predictions.
For example, if \(f_1 \in [0, 100]\) and \(f_2 \in [0, 1]\), \(f_1\) will always be penalized more than \(f_2\) when computing the distance.
  To mitigate this, normalize the feature&amp;rsquo;s ranges to \([r_{low}, r_{high}]\):
$$ a&amp;rsquo;_i = \frac{a_i - a_{min}}{ a_{max} - a_{min}} \cdot (r_{high} - r_{low}) + r_{low} $$
Typically, the range is normalized to \([r_{low}, r_{high}] = [0, 1]\), so range normalization simplifies to:</description>

      <description>The Formula By definition&amp;hellip;
$$ \mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A \cap B) + \mathbb{P}(A \cap B^{c}) $$
From conditional probability &amp;hellip;
$$ \mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A|B) \ \mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A|B^c) \ \mathbb{P}(B^c) $$
Therefore
$$ \mathbb{P}(B|A) = \frac{ \mathbb{P}(B \cap A) }{ \mathbb{P}(A) } $$ $$ = \frac{ \mathbb{P}(A|B) \mathbb{P}(B) }{ \mathbb{P}(A|B) \ \mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A|B^c) \ \mathbb{P}(B^c) } $$
Switching the roles of the events is convenient because in many problems, one of the conditional probabilities is easier to calculate.</description>

      <description>Is There Momentum in the Stock Market? Past stock prices cannot be used reliably to foretell future movements. Furthermore, transactions costs and taxes make it hard to exploit any short-term momentum.
Flip a fair coin many times. Sequences of heads (or tails) and jumbled up sequences occur with equal probability.
Just What Exactly is a Random Walk? In a random walk, knowing all prior moves is no help in predicting the next move.</description>

      <description>Return the Average Value One possible solution is to return the average value in the neighborhood, i.e.
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i $$
We can improve this by using weighted \(k-NN\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} \cdot t_i \right) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} } $$
The formula looks new. However, if \(x_1\) is weighted by \(w_1\) and \(x_2\) by \(w_2\), then the weighted average is:
$$ \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 }{w_1 + w_2} $$</description>

      <description>Fundamentalists tout past earnings growth as a most reliable indicator of future growth. But academics have shown that past earnings growth are no help in predicting future growth.
Why is the Crystal Ball So Clouded?  Many of the influential changes that affect earnings prospects are unpredictable. Creative accounting procedures produce dubious reported earnings, e.g. pro forma earnings, pushing due payments to future years, etc. Analysts may make errors, e.g. over-estimating the market size.</description>

      <description>The mystical perfect risk measure is still beyond our grasp. That said, here are some common ones:
Beta and Systematic Risk Systematic risk of a security arises from the variability of the general stock market. Diversification does not reduce this risk.
Unsystematic risk is the remaining variability that is due to a company&amp;rsquo;s particular factors, e.g. a strike. Diversification reduces this risk. There is no reason for extra compensation.
Beta is a measure of the systematic risk.</description>

      <description>Behavioralists believe that:
 Investors are not rational in present and future valuations of securities. There are substantial barriers to efficient arbitrage.  The Irrational Behavior of Individual Investors Overconfidence People tend to be overconfident, e.g. in a survey, 94% of male respondents believed that their athleticism was above average.
Hindsight bias makes the world seem predictable. Investors might think they can beat the market.

The Sharpe Ratio: (excess return over the risk-free rate) / (risk of the strategy). The risk-free rate is usually the return from a 3-month treasury bill. Higher Sharpe Ratios are better.

      <description>Ian&amp;rsquo;s specialty was immunoassays. His contentions: the devices fell short of the lab bench&amp;rsquo;s accuracy; there was little communication between groups; Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s dishonesty about Theranos&amp;rsquo; capbilities.
Ian confided in Channing Robertson, who parroted to Elizabeth, who fired Ian.
But his colleagues lobbied him back in. He was in a demoted position though. Paul, previous mentee turned manager, was more compromising with the engineers.
Ian was dismayed that Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s name was usually in 1st place on patents despite negligible scientific contribution.</description>

      <description>Chiat\Day was the agency that Apple had used. Therefore, Theranos would too.
Patrick (Chiat\Day) was enamored by Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s mission. The website models featured all demographics. Elizabeth scheduled Wednesday meetings because that&amp;rsquo;s how Apple did it.
Stan Fiorito (Chiat\Day) was more circumspect. Sunny&amp;rsquo;s sales targets had measly research. How were they affording $6m/year retainer?
Elizabeth claimed Theranos was saving soldiers&amp;rsquo; lives in Afghanistan. She wanted bold claims:
 800 tests on a drop of blood More accurate than traditional lab testing Tests ready in &amp;lt; 30min Tests approved by the FDA and endorsed by key medical centers.</description>

      <description>Theranos&amp;rsquo;s Lab was divided into two. The upstairs one, CLIA-certified, was full of commercial diagnostic equipment. The downstairs one had Theranos&amp;rsquo;s tech.
2.5 years of the miniLab&amp;rsquo;s development. But it was still a work in progress. In medical device standards, 3 years is a short time.
Sycophants were promoted. Many employees were on H1-B, so they needed Theranos&amp;rsquo;s employment.
After LTC Shoemaker, Elizabeth scrapped the remote diagnostics. The samples were to be couriered to Palo Alto.</description>

      <description>Elizabeth used Shultz&amp;rsquo;s connections to get a WSJ Weekend Interview to coincide with the launch. The interview was a friendly setting, with a pro-business &amp;amp; anti-regulation ethos.
Theranos was about to launch. Its devices were being used by the military too. Elizabeth offered Don Lucas a discount investment opportunity - $15m at a $6b valuation; 7 years ago, Theranos was valued at $40m.
Uber had raised $361m at $3.5b. Spotify raised $250m at $4b.</description>

      <description>The Edison&amp;rsquo;s innards were mostly a pipette fastened to a robotic arm. But it had a [buggy] touchscreen interface, so&amp;hellip;
A test is considered precise if its coefficient of variation (CV) is below 10%. Data runs that failed to meet the threshold were discarded. Of six values, Theranos only reported the median to the patient.
Theranos also argued that proficiency testing results were assessed by comparing them to its peers&amp;rsquo; results.</description>

      <description>Richard and Joe Fuisz were tired and battered. They had already spent $2m+ on their defense. What if they lost and were made to cover Theranos&amp;rsquo;s legal expenses?
Richard agreed to withdraw patent in exchange for Theranos withdrawing its suit. The Fuiszes had lost. But Joe demanded a public apology from Theranos.
Roger Parloff, Fortune Magazine&amp;rsquo;s legal correspondent saw the settlement in Litigation Daily. After speaking to Shultz, Perry, Kissinger, Nunn, Mattis and the 2 new directors: Kovacevich (former Wells Fargo CEO) and Frist (former Senate majority leader), came the June 2014 cover story that catapulted Elizabeth to fame: This CEO Is Out for Blood.</description>

      <description>Alan talked Elizabeth and Sunny out of running HIV tests on diluted finger-stick samples - unreliable potassium and cholesterol results were bad enough.
Alan was tired of convincing physicians that blood test results were sound and accurate. He chose to resign and asked his name be taken off the lab&amp;rsquo;s CLIA license. Alan got served with an affidavit.
How could Alan go against the most fabled SV unicorn? The litigation would bankrupt him.</description>

      <description>Alan retrieved the proficiency testing email chain through a whistleblower law firm. He forwarded the thread to Carreyrou. The thread showed Sunny admonishing Alan &amp;amp; Mark for running proficiency tests on the Edison and admitting that the device had &amp;ldquo;failed&amp;rdquo; the test. Elizabeth was copied on most of the emails.
Carreyrou tracked Carmen Washington, who had complained about Theranos&amp;rsquo;s blood tests in Walgreens. 3 of her patients had received questionable test results.</description>

      <description>Charlotte: I doubt if Theranos&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;box&amp;rsquo; is real. Henry [Kissinger] doubts too and he&amp;rsquo;s been saying he wants out.
Tyler got served with an affidavit stating that he&amp;rsquo;d never spoken to any third parties about Theranos and that he&amp;rsquo;d give names of [ex]employees who he knew had talked to WSJ.
George: Tyler isn&amp;rsquo;t a snitch. Finding out who spoke to WSJ is Theranos&amp;rsquo;s problem.
Tyler declined to name WSJ&amp;rsquo;s other sources.</description>

      <description>Carreyrou &amp;amp; WSJ vs. Boies Schiller The Boies Schiller delegation was led by David Boies himself!
Admissions: Ownership of commercial blood analyzers; problematic potassium test was a known issue, and no faulty results had been released to patients.
Siemens ADVIA? Special dilution on ADVIA? Number of tests done by the Edison? Trade secret!
Boies Schiller and witnesses Tyler was young and unqualified; disgruntled ex-employees are unreliable.

      <description>The FDA had approved Theranos&amp;rsquo;s finger-stick tests for HSV-1. But to be fair, the herpes test is a qualtitative (yes/no) test. Most tests are quantitative. Arizona was about to pass a law (lobbied for by yours truly) to allow citizens to get blood tested without a doctor&amp;rsquo;s order.
Elizabeth had also gotten cozy with the Obama administration.
Instead of showing an error message, the miniLab&amp;rsquo;s screen now showed the test&amp;rsquo;s progress slowing to a crawl.</description>

      <description>Rupert Murdoch led the most recent $430m funding round with $125m. He followed his gut: he&amp;rsquo;d invested $150k in Uber for it to become $50m.
The investment packket forecasted (profit revenue) of ($330m, $1b) in 2015 and ($505m, $2b) in 2016. Furthermore, Theranos had lined up Cox Enterprises, The Waltons, New England Patriots owner, Carlos Slim, controller of Fiat Chrysler.
Elizabeth brought up Carreyrou&amp;rsquo;s story to Murdoch, but Murdoch declined to intervene - saying he trusted the paper&amp;rsquo;s editors to handle the matter fairly.</description>

      <description>[3 weeks before first article] Erika Cheung&amp;rsquo;s email to Gary Yamamoto (CMS) spurred the surprise inspection on Theranos&amp;rsquo;s labs in less than 3 days. They found so many problems and missing documentation that they planned to return. When they returned, WSJ&amp;rsquo;s article was out and there was pressure. CMS released a letter calling Theranos an &amp;ldquo;immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety&amp;rdquo;.
Theranos claimed to have fixed many of the deficiencies, and that the problems had no bearing on the soundness of its proprietary tech.</description>

To resolve SEC&amp;rsquo;s civil charges, Elizabeth was forced to relinquish her voting control, give back a big chunk of stock, pay a $500k penalty and not be an officer/director in a public company for 10 years.
Sunny didn&amp;rsquo;t join Theranos until late 2009. Elizabeth had already been misleading pharmaceutical companies for years about the readiness of her tech.</description>

      <description>Classifying mathematics by its subject matter may be misleading because the kinds of questions being asked may be the same, despite different subject matter.
Nonetheless, classifying by subject matter, we crudely have algebra, geometry and analysis.
Algebra vs. Geometry It&amp;rsquo;s insufficient to claim that algebra contains symbols, while arithmetic contains numbers. In advanced mathematics, numbers rarely appear without letters.
Manipulating symbols through rules, e.g. do the same to both sides, is thought of as algebra.</description>

Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&amp;rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy.

Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction?

It seems that the onus is on mail list maintainers to instruct users how to make sure that future emails get routed to the &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; tab, e.</description>

      <description>The sums of powers, \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^a \), can be computed more efficiently if we have a closed formula for them.
Sum of powers for a = 1, 2, 3 $$ \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$
One [intuitive] derivation is presented at brilliant.org []:
$$ S_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + &amp;hellip; + n $$
&amp;hellip; can be reordered as:
$$ S_n = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + &amp;hellip; + 1 $$</description>

      <description>Exercise 1: Have a regular savings program. Start investing early because compound interest and time are you greatest resource.
When it comes to setting saving accounts&amp;rsquo; interest rates   with regard to the interest rate that banks enjoy from the fed  , banks are downwards-flexible and upwards-sticky. Depositors lose the tune of $100b when interest rates are rising. []

      <description>What determines the returns from stocks and bonds? A stock buyer expects a growing stream of dividends. If the company re-invests its profits, the stock buyer expects more rapidly growing dividends in the future, or a lucrative stock buyback.
Long-run Equity Return = Initial Dividend Yield + Growth Rate
In the short run (e.g. a year) the changes in price/dividend or price/earnings multiples determine returns. In optimistic times, e.g. March 2000, P/E &amp;gt; 30 and P/D &amp;gt; 80.</description>

      <description>The Food Delivery Mafia Google allows certain booking and ordering services from third-party providers (e.g. Doordash) to automatically appear with business listings. To edit such links, the business has to contact the third party. Complaints by restaurants: Doordash has poor service that reflects on the restaurant; sometimes owners have their own delivery service which is circumvented; Doordash charges the restaurant for orders made through them. []
It&amp;rsquo;s more likely that Doordash and Grubhub will have more technical expertise to navigate online listings - they have deep money-losing, but user-growth-fueling pockets (e.</description>

The Need for Commutativity Say we have a queue \( 1 \to 2 \). Suppose two replicas, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), independently call pop(). Each replica will have \(2\) on their queue.
However, on receiving an update that the other replica popped, each replica will call pop() to be consistent, thereby deleting \(2\).</description>

      <description>Faster Human Trials In 1986, AZT (AIDS treatment) showed 1/145 deaths compared to the placebo&amp;rsquo;s 16/137. 6,000 AIDS patients were offered AZT, helping it get to the public much faster. []
Different rules apply in a pandemic. If the treatment is sufficiently promising, we should skip to human clinical trials. Covid-19 has a lower fatality rate than AIDS, which set a precedent. 3,000 altruists have even offered to deliberately expose themselves to covid-19!</description>

      <description>On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&amp;rsquo;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read.</description>

      <description>The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)  
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s why quant funds are not a thing in Kenya.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s All About Real Estate I admit that I&amp;rsquo;m biased towards the conclusion that the Kenyan real estate market is in a bubble. My &amp;lsquo;evidence&amp;rsquo; is the notion that people are buying land, holding onto it as it appreciates, then selling it off. Reminds me of Malkiel&amp;rsquo;s discussion on how the crowd can get uber-speculative, abandoning reality itself

New Caledonian crows make hooked tools from soft twigs to scoop insects out of holes. Other animals that use tools: chimpanzees, parrots, alligators and crabs.
The crows found the desired stems even when they had been disguised with leaves from a different plant species.
There are anecdotes of crow intelligence too, e.g. using cars at a crosslight to crush cashews in Japan (more in this HN thread  )</description>

The challenge is to match a string like .--...-.-.-.....-.--........----.-.-..---.---.--.--.-.-....-..-...-.---..--.----.. to a permutation of the English alphabet that would produce it, e.g. wirnbfzehatqlojpgcvusyxkmd. Note that there may be more than one valid permutation.
Solution I&amp;rsquo;m used to problems where the resources are not depleted, e.g. I can use a as many times as I want. The trickiest part was keeping track of the substring indexes.</description>

Growing big antlers requires lots of Ca and Ph, which are rare. Small antlers were required to survive low-food winters, but big antlers were required to impress females to mate. The Irish elk spiraled to extinction.
I get the analogy that Housel is trying to paint, but this seems like an oversimplification. Sure, big antlers are sexy, but if small antlers are all that&amp;rsquo;s left on the menu, I doubt female antlers will think &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;.</description>

BOGO goods are usually low-demand, non-efficient, lacking in quality and/or close to the expiration date. The BOGO deal is usually a 50% discount off of the manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price (MSRP). And oftentimes, this price is artificially marked up to begin with.
 MyPillow offered BOGO deal on their pillows, but really just doubled the price of the first pillow.</description>

      <description>DP in the 2020 US Census Scenario:
 Census bureau releases mean household income by block \(N - 1\) households in a block can work together to infer the outcome of household \(N\)  Solution:
  Define \(i_{max}\), the hypothetical maximum income
  To protect outliers (like Jeff and Bill) clip their values to \(i_{max}\) before computing the mean
  Add noise to mean income that&amp;rsquo;s proportional to \(i_{max} / \epsilon\)</description>

Irrational numbers occupy most of the number line. If you were to pick a number on the number line at random, there is literally a 100% chance that it will be irrational (probabilities with inifinities are spooky). Yet, we almost never encounter irrational numbers for we can&amp;rsquo;t write them down.
The shapes we know best - lines, parabolas, circles, spheres - are the needles, for they can be expressed by simple equations.</description>

You have a clear execution path - they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&amp;rsquo;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>

      <description>Immeasurably Important.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/ . Jul 5, 2018.  Filtering out information is an art, not a science, necessitated by the information overload that we live in.
 Watch out for the tendency to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world should be. If you think the world is all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about intuitively.</description>

      <description>Horsemen of the End of Enlightenment Kissinger&amp;rsquo;s waking call was the triumph of AlphaGo. He is wary of the self-learning machine.
The printing press sparked the Age of Reason. However, a world reliant on data &amp;amp; algorithms, uncontrollable by ethical/philosophical norms will upend the Age of Reason. The people developing AI care more about technical feats than ethical/philosophical issues.
Harbingers of the end of enlightenment: information overload diverts people from introspection, ability to target micro-groups breaks up the previous consensus on priorities.</description>

People underestimate the role played by luck. Given \(N\) investors, if \(N\) is large enough, a couple of them will luck their way into billions.
But every investor seems to be doing due diligence. The successful ones will be more convinced that their methods really work.
Considering the amount of investing books out there, we should be seeing a lot more Warren Buffets in the world.</description>

      <description>Description  Link to original problem  
In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)   is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. The most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.</description>

That is, the ensemble averages equal the corresponding time averages with probability one.

      <description>No Clarity Around Growth Mindset.  Scott Alexander. Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/08/no-clarity-around-growth-mindset-yet/ . Apr 8, 2015.  Growth mindset: people who believe effort - and not ability - determines success are more resilient, skillful, hard-working, perseverant in the face of failure.
Most of the growth mindset experiments prime their subjects, but recent priming experiments have famously failed to replicate. Dweck&amp;rsquo;s experiment:
 Group A: easy test (success) -&amp;gt; final bound-to-fail test Group B: hard test (told they&amp;rsquo;re not working hard enough) -&amp;gt; final bound-to-fail test Group B outperformed Group A.</description>

      <description>Letting Go.  Eliezer Yudkowsky. Rationality: From AI to Zombies. Feb 1, 2015.  Learn when to admit failure It&amp;rsquo;s important to have a watershed moment and acknowledge a fundamental problem, instead of dividing it into palatable bite-size mistakes.
LTCM were exploiting market inefficiencies. Other people learned of the tricks. LTCM didn&amp;rsquo;t lose hope. They borrowed more and more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins.
And their math probably said the leverage was okay.</description>

Overweight people, depressed people, and poor people aren‚Äôt fully to blame for their situation ‚Äì and neither are unintelligent people. It‚Äôs accidents of birth all the way down.
Srinivasa Ramanujan:
 Grew up in poverty in a one-room house in small-town India. But a lot of poor people in the US had better conditions/opportunities  Either, a lot of intelligence is innate Or, those poor people are just not trying hard enough.</description>

      <description>Do Things That Don&amp;#39;t Scale.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html . Jul 1, 2013.  Recruit manually. Don&amp;rsquo;t send links. Set them up on the spot.
Ask how big the startup would be if you did the right things, not whether you&amp;rsquo;re currently changing the world.
Delight your initial customers. Tim Cook can&amp;rsquo;t send handwritten notes, but you can.
If you can solve the problem manually, do so while gradually automating the most pressing bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>How Doctors Die.  Zocalo Public Square. https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/ideas/nexus/ .  Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &amp;lsquo;do everything&amp;rsquo;, but often they mean &amp;lsquo;do everything that‚Äôs reasonable.&amp;rsquo; But they may not know what‚Äôs reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish.</description>

      <description>The Submarine.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html . Apr 1, 2005.  Many people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come.</description>
