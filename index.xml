      <description>Holmes had an all-star team: Larry Ellison&#39;s mentor as Chair, Associate Dean of Stanford&#39;s School of Engineering, 30 years IBM experience, 25 years pharma and biotech experience, Panasonic&#39;s chip-making subsidiary head&amp;hellip;
Fraud or not, this is a sick lineup! How could she mess this up?
  Big Pharma spends tens of $B on clinical trials each year. Theranos would enable them to adjust dosage and save 30%. Holmes insisted on revising financial projections upward - assuming all (15+) deals came through - to $1.</description>

      <description>Random walk: future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. Thus, short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable.
Investing as a Way of Life Today Difference between speculations and investments: time period and predictability of the return.
To stay even, your returns must match inflation (averaged 4% from 1962 to 2018).
With regard to beating inflation, that implies all the money that&#39;s in people&#39;s bank accounts is depreciating, as opposed to maintaining value.</description>

      <description>Holmes wanted to be a billionaire since childhood. Her parents were from wealth, with medical and military folk. Holmes attended Houston&#39;s most prestigious private school. She spoke her way into Stanford&#39;s Mandarin program, while still in high school. Parents insisted on living a purposeful life.
Worked in lab during school year. Freshman internship at Genome Institute of Singapore: nasal swabs and syringes. There had to be a better way.
Ah, the transformative experience abroad.</description>

      <description>The Tulip Bulb Craze Virus causes colored stripes in tulip petals. The Dutch valued such bulbs. Prices rose (just when one thought they couldn&#39;t go higher). Let the tulipmania begin.
Note: And that&#39;s where FOMO comes in. You can&#39;t argue with the results. You just want to dip your toes and get out. I watched Bitcoin keep climbing, until I got into the game with $50&amp;hellip;

      <description>Holmes insisted on using just a prick of blood. Problem: unreproducible results. A miniaturized catridge made storing and using the reagents hard.
You can&#39;t Steve Jobs your way through medical devices. But you can&#39;t change the world by being cynical.
  Costs. Each cartridge cost +$200 to make and was single use. Holmes even purchased a $2m automated packaging line.
Control of Information. The biochemists and the engineers reported up to Holmes and weren&#39;t encouraged to communicate with each other.</description>

      <description>Holmes&#39;s Grand Plans. The iPod of health care. Build a personal disease map; reverse engineer cancer and predict evolution of tumors.
Again, if she&#39;s faking this belief, then its sociopathic. But maybe she thought she could do it. Inventors go where no one else dares. They&#39;re ridiculed by society. Here&#39;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.

      <description>For some terminated employees, Holmes requested a dossier on them for leverage. Mosley (finance guy) had stored porn on his work laptop. Holmes (retroactively) used that as the cause for his termination and lack of stock options.
Matt (IT) wanted to leave to start IT consulting firm. Holmes asking him to use ununionized (mob controlled) movers for a last minute move from East Paly was one of the final straws. Holmes tried asking Matt&#39;s peer to build dossier in exchange for Matt&#39;s position, but they declined.</description>

      <description>The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)
I guess that&#39;s why quant funds are not a thing in Kenya.</description>

      <description>Investing through Groups (Chamas) www.kaig.org has developed a Chama Handbook to boost accountability and profitability.
But chamas have a higher chance of being guided by friendships than profitability. For instance, how do I go about picking a chama? It&#39;s most likely a referral from a friend who&#39;s already in a chama.

      <description> etfdb.com has ETFs tracking regions. Surprised that Kenya isn&#39;t on it. And they&#39;re all losing money - best (over 5 years) is SA at -14.59%, Nigeria is at -64%.   Why all the PR on Africa being the next big investment scene?  Of course, Kenya&#39;s the premier investment destination (invest.go.ke)   Am I reading this right??

      <description>I&#39;m Chege Gitau. I was born and raised in Kenya. My hobbies include basketball, video games, reading books &amp;amp; blogs and drinking plain milk.
I blog because it helps me improve my clarity. It also reminds me that I have something worth saying. I envision my posts taking the form of interesting questions. More often than not, my training as a computer scientist will avail tools to help me answer those questions.</description>
