      <description>Holmes had an all-star team: Larry Ellison&#39;s mentor as Chair, Associate Dean of Stanford&#39;s School of Engineering, 30 years IBM experience, 25 years pharma and biotech experience, Panasonic&#39;s chip-making subsidiary head&amp;hellip;
Fraud or not, this is a sick lineup! How could she mess this up?
  Big Pharma spends tens of $B on clinical trials each year. Theranos would enable them to adjust dosage and save 30%. Holmes insisted on revising financial projections upward - assuming all (15+) deals came through - to $1.</description>

      <description>Quiz It&#39;s hard to give pessimistic answers when the book&#39;s title says &amp;ldquo;Things Are Better Than You Think&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
    In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?
üî≤‚ÄÖA: 20 percent
‚ùå‚ÄÖB: 40 percent
‚úÖ‚ÄÖC: 60 percent
There has been lots of efforts to get girls to finish primary school, e.g. providing sanitary towels. Surely, they must be at \( \ge 40% \) completion rates.</description>

      <description>The order of learning: the necessary, the useful, the ornamental.
A teacher&#39;s duty is to show the student what he can do for themselves and how to do it.
Knowing how to study is especially important because college can only cover so much. Furthermore, a student&#39;s career requirements may change.
Nothing is true simply because it is in a book. It must pass the test of one&#39;s understanding. In case the understanding is beyond the student, they must perceive whether it&#39;s mere fact, definition or opinion.</description>

      <description>Mum: Tiger-Mum tendencies, smart, gullible. Dad: non-academic, vocational.
Young Jimmy independently arrived at Zeno&#39;s Paradox, and concluded that the family car should never need gas.
Reminds me of an anecdote a friend told me about intern interviews for one of the big banks. Something like, if you keep moving half the distance, how many moves do you need to make in order to touch some object? The expected answer was impossible, but I didn&#39;t buy it.</description>

      <description>Fall 1990. Simons had spent 12 years searching for a successful investing formula. In 1989, his net returns were -4.0%. In 1988, he had netted 9.0%. In 1990, he netted 55.0% (77.8% before fees).
With Elywn Berlekamp, game theorist professor at UCB, Simons built a model for selecting idea trades based on data.
Berlekamp knew their approach was alchemic - no cash flows, interest rate forecasts, product research. Some of the trade recommendations didn&#39;t make sense.</description>

      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674. Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&#39;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>The access patterns for a data system (e.g. database, cache, etc.) motivate different implementations, and thus performance characteristics.
Because many applications have a wide range of requirements, single tools no longer meet all of the data processing and storage needs. It&#39;s up to the application to stitch together different tools.
Despite the behind-the-scenes stitching, the data system may provide certain guarantees, e.g. the cache will be correctly invalidated.</description>

      <description>Signal Is Finally Bringing Its Secure Messaging To the Masses.  Andy Greenberg. https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/. https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/02/14/2216214/signal-is-finally-bringing-its-secure-messaging-to-the-masses#comments. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22326731. Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&#39;d think that at Signal&#39;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&#39;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&#39;t look like it will monetize soon.
  Signal has added support for iPad, ephemeral images and video, downloadable customizable &amp;ldquo;stickers,&amp;rdquo; and emoji reactions.</description>

      <description>Random walk: future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. Thus, short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable.
Investing as a Way of Life Today Difference between speculations and investments: time period and predictability of the return.
To stay even, your returns must match inflation (averaged 4% from 1962 to 2018).
With regard to beating inflation, that implies all the money that&#39;s in people&#39;s bank accounts is depreciating, as opposed to maintaining value.</description>

      <description>Holmes wanted to be a billionaire since childhood. Her parents were from wealth, with medical and military folk. Holmes attended Houston&#39;s most prestigious private school. She spoke her way into Stanford&#39;s Mandarin program, while still in high school. Parents insisted on living a purposeful life.
Worked in lab during school year. Freshman internship at Genome Institute of Singapore: nasal swabs and syringes. There had to be a better way.

      <description>Bernoulli Process A Bernoulli Process is a sequence of independent \({0, 1}\) - valued random variables \(X_1, X_2, X_3, &amp;hellip;\), e.g. \(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1\)
A Bernoulli Process does not mandate that the probability distributions of the \(X_i\) be identical. That is up to the model that we choose. For instance, the Binomial Random Variable assumes \(\mathbb{P}\{X_i = 1\} = p \ \ \forall i\)
  Suppose you flip a coin repeatedly, and record \(0\) for tails and \(1\) for heads.</description>

But if we observe all turkeys in the US, won&#39;t we notice that they&#39;re more likely to die right before Thanksgiving? Zooming out to the bigger picture invalidates Taleb&#39;s point.

      <description>The Proper Use of Humility Confessing your fallibility but doing nothing about it braggery, not humility. Designing fail-safe machinery is good humility. Dismissing evidence for evolution because we can&#39;t really know for sure that evolution is correct is misplaced humility.
The Third Alternative Sometimes we justify questionable policy by claiming its absence is undesirable, e.g. believing in Santa makes children behave nicely, and therefore Santa-ism is the best of all possible alternatives.</description>

      <description>Distinguish Mere Facts From Conclusions or Opinions Discriminate between mere statements of facts, necessary conclusions which follow therefrom, and mere opinions which they seem to render reasonable.
There&#39;s no need to perform an experiment to verify that the atomic weight of oxygen is 16.
That the sum of the angles of a plane triangle equals two right angles is not a mere fact, but an inevitable truth.

      <description>A fault is when a component deviates from its spec, while a failure is when the system no longer provides the required service to the user.
Better to design fault-tolerant systems because we can&#39;t reduce the probability of a fault to zero.
In fault-tolerant systems, one should trigger faults deliberately in order to test the tolerance, e.g. randomly killing individual processes.
However, not all things can be tolerated. For instance, if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, then the damage can&#39;t be undone.</description>

      <description>Topic 2: Shell Tools.  MIT Computer Science. https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/.  Unlike other scripting programming languages, shell scripting is optimized for shell related tasks, e.g. reading from STDIN and saving results into files are primitives.
At the cost of being painful on the eyes. Python scripts are way more readable (and cross-platform) than shell scripts.

      <description>More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.
Why is this cause of disaster so common?  Our estimation techniques assume that all will go well, i.e. each task will take only as long as it &amp;ldquo;ought&amp;rdquo; to take. Our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are interchangeable. Because we are uncertain of our estimates, software managers often lack the courteous stubbornness - if you&#39;re made to wait, it is to serve you better, and to please you.</description>

If finance were Gaussian, then the 2008 crash (more than 20 std) would take place every several billion lifetimes of the universe. In the last 50 years, the 10 most extreme days in finance markets represent half the returns.

      <description>Gathering evidence IRL may be expensive. When picking a stopping point, ask whether the collected evidence compels the conclusion, not whether it allows the conclusion.
Check your motivations. Are you ignoring fast cheap evidence because you already have a comfortable conclusion? Are you holding out for expensive slow evidence because the conclusion is uncomfortable?
A probabilistic model can take a few hits. But we sometimes assume a true theory can have no failures and a false theory can have no success.</description>

Matt (IT) wanted to leave to start IT consulting firm. Holmes asking him to use ununionized (mob controlled) movers for a last minute move from East Paly was one of the final straws. Holmes tried asking Matt&#39;s peer to build dossier in exchange for Matt&#39;s position, but they declined.</description>

      <description>Pick the best book. New to a subject? Start with the elementary one.
Study a few subjects at once, but not too many. The mind needs change of occupation, not idleness.
Weigh carefully before taking up or dropping a study. Read much but not many books.
Fix your mind intensely on one thing for a time long enough to make progress.
Apply what you&#39;re studying. Book knowledge is of little value in itself.</description>

So in a way, Elizabeth didn&#39;t grow up in wealth? This puts a spin on Chapter 01: A Purposeful Life.

      <description>Is There Momentum in the Stock Market? Past stock prices cannot be used reliably to foretell future movements. Furthermore, transactions costs and taxes make it hard to exploit any short-term momentum.
Flip a fair coin many times. Sequences of heads (or tails) and jumbled up sequences occur with equal probability.
Just What Exactly is a Random Walk? In a random walk, knowing all prior moves is no help in predicting the next move.</description>

      <description>Fundamentalists tout past earnings growth as a most reliable indicator of future growth. But academics have shown that past earnings growth are no help in predicting future growth.
Why is the Crystal Ball So Clouded?  Many of the influential changes that affect earnings prospects are unpredictable. Creative accounting procedures produce dubious reported earnings, e.g. pro forma earnings, pushing due payments to future years, etc. Analysts may make errors, e.g. over-estimating the market size.</description>

      <description>The miniLab, 4S for short, stemmed from the need for a device that could perform more than just one class of tests. Theranos value prop was now minituarization, as opposed to invention. Current blood analyzers used too much blood and did too few tests.
Kent, de-facto Chief Architect of the miniLab, had raised $215k on Kickstarter for his bike lights side project. Elizabeth and Sunny wanted the patent to be transferred to Theranos.</description>

      <description>The mystical perfect risk measure is still beyond our grasp. That said, here are some common ones:
Beta and Systematic Risk Systematic risk of a security arises from the variability of the general stock market. Diversification does not reduce this risk.
Unsystematic risk is the remaining variability that is due to a company&#39;s particular factors, e.g. a strike. Diversification reduces this risk. There is no reason for extra compensation.
Beta is a measure of the systematic risk.</description>

      <description>Safeway was doing poorly. Burd teased with a &amp;lsquo;wellness play&amp;rsquo;. He expected the clinics&amp;rsquo; to recoup the $350m renovation costs. Testing and rewarding employees would reduce Safeway&#39;s health care costs.
Theranos would courier samples to Palo Alto for testing. Theranos used a lancet on the index finger AND the good old hypodermic needle to the arm. The results could take 2 weeks as opposed to near-instantaneous. Theranos&#39;s results tended to be way off, unless they had been outsourced.</description>

      <description>Behavioralists believe that:
 Investors are not rational in present and future valuations of securities. There are substantial barriers to efficient arbitrage.  The Irrational Behavior of Individual Investors Overconfidence People tend to be overconfident, e.g. in a survey, 94% of male respondents believed that their athleticism was above average.
Hindsight bias makes the world seem predictable. Investors might think they can beat the market.
The tendency of &amp;ldquo;growth&amp;rdquo; stocks to underperform &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; stocks shows how overoptimistic growth forecasts are.</description>

      <description>Elizabeth had successfully pitched to James Mattis, 4-star General, about deploying Theranos in Afghanistan. General Mattis was known to look out for his troops.
Elizabeth&#39;s plan around regulation - the real blood analysis would be beamed to California to be done by professionals; only the CLIA compliance for the Palo Alto lab was needed - no FDA.
Lt. Col. Shoemaker, responsible for the army&#39;s compliance with medical regulations, was openly critical of the Theranos&amp;rsquo; workaround.</description>

      <description>Smart Beta Using relatively passive-rule based strategies to gain greater than market returns without assuming more risk than investing in a low-cost total stock market index fund.
The Sharpe Ratio: (excess return over the risk-free rate) / (risk of the strategy). The risk-free rate is usually the return from a 3-month treasury bill. Higher Sharpe Ratios are better.
Smart beta argues that pure indexing (weighting by market cap) is not optimal.</description>

      <description>Elizabeth sued Richard Fuisz claiming he used Joe &amp;amp; John Fuisz to steal confidential information at McDermott Will &amp;amp; Emery, in order to build the rival patent. Note that John thought his father, Richard, was overbearing.
David Boies was legendary: antitrust against MSFT, Al Gore on contested 2000 election, overturning ban on gay marriage in CA. He also intimidated opponents with private investigators.

      <description>Ian&#39;s specialty was immunoassays. His contentions: the devices fell short of the lab bench&#39;s accuracy; there was little communication between groups; Elizabeth&#39;s dishonesty about Theranos&amp;rsquo; capbilities.
Ian confided in Channing Robertson, who parroted to Elizabeth, who fired Ian.
But his colleagues lobbied him back in. He was in a demoted position though. Paul, previous mentee turned manager, was more compromising with the engineers.
Ian was dismayed that Elizabeth&#39;s name was usually in 1st place on patents despite negligible scientific contribution.</description>

      <description>Chiat\Day was the agency that Apple had used. Therefore, Theranos would too.
Patrick (Chiat\Day) was enamored by Elizabeth&#39;s mission. The website models featured all demographics. Elizabeth scheduled Wednesday meetings because that&#39;s how Apple did it.
Stan Fiorito (Chiat\Day) was more circumspect. Sunny&#39;s sales targets had measly research. How were they affording $6m/year retainer?
Elizabeth claimed Theranos was saving soldiers&amp;rsquo; lives in Afghanistan. She wanted bold claims:
 800 tests on a drop of blood More accurate than traditional lab testing Tests ready in &amp;lt; 30min Tests approved by the FDA and endorsed by key medical centers.</description>

2.5 years of the miniLab&#39;s development. But it was still a work in progress. In medical device standards, 3 years is a short time.
Sycophants were promoted. Many employees were on H1-B, so they needed Theranos&#39;s employment.
After LTC Shoemaker, Elizabeth scrapped the remote diagnostics. The samples were to be couriered to Palo Alto.</description>

      <description>Elizabeth used Shultz&#39;s connections to get a WSJ Weekend Interview to coincide with the launch. The interview was a friendly setting, with a pro-business &amp;amp; anti-regulation ethos.
Theranos was about to launch. Its devices were being used by the military too. Elizabeth offered Don Lucas a discount investment opportunity - $15m at a $6b valuation; 7 years ago, Theranos was valued at $40m.
Uber had raised $361m at $3.5b. Spotify raised $250m at $4b.</description>

      <description>The Edison&#39;s innards were mostly a pipette fastened to a robotic arm. But it had a [buggy] touchscreen interface, so&amp;hellip;
A test is considered precise if its coefficient of variation (CV) is below 10%. Data runs that failed to meet the threshold were discarded. Of six values, Theranos only reported the median to the patient.
Theranos also argued that proficiency testing results were assessed by comparing them to its peers&amp;rsquo; results.</description>

      <description>Richard and Joe Fuisz were tired and battered. They had already spent $2m+ on their defense. What if they lost and were made to cover Theranos&#39;s legal expenses?
Richard agreed to withdraw patent in exchange for Theranos withdrawing its suit. The Fuiszes had lost. But Joe demanded a public apology from Theranos.
Roger Parloff, Fortune Magazine&#39;s legal correspondent saw the settlement in Litigation Daily. After speaking to Shultz, Perry, Kissinger, Nunn, Mattis and the 2 new directors: Kovacevich (former Wells Fargo CEO) and Frist (former Senate majority leader), came the June 2014 cover story that catapulted Elizabeth to fame: This CEO Is Out for Blood.</description>

      <description>The FDA had approved Theranos&#39;s finger-stick tests for HSV-1. But to be fair, the herpes test is a qualtitative (yes/no) test. Most tests are quantitative. Arizona was about to pass a law (lobbied for by yours truly) to allow citizens to get blood tested without a doctor&#39;s order.
Elizabeth had also gotten cozy with the Obama administration.

Different rules apply in a pandemic. If the treatment is sufficiently promising, we should skip to human clinical trials. Covid-19 has a lower fatality rate than AIDS, which set a precedent. 3,000 altruists have even offered to deliberately expose themselves to covid-19!</description>

      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&#39;t care whether you&#39;ll remember what you&#39;ve read. []
But even if you don&#39;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>

      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &amp;ldquo;Life After Hate&amp;rdquo; suggested to them. []
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?</description>

      <description>Non-Competitiveness of Local Industry Prestige Ameritech is America&#39;s #1 maker of surgical masks. In outbreaks, demand peaks, but when it&#39;s all over, hospitals go back to exclusively buying cheaper masks from China. Reduced demand makes Ameritech lay off workers. Ameritech is pushing for a federal contract to stabilize demand over time. []

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94% [] Google Directions API limited their free tier. CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.

      <description>Markov Chains and Baum A hidden Markov process is one in which the results of the chain are visible, but not the states that help explain the progression of the chain. Like receiving the number of runs scored in each inning without knowing anything about baseball.
The Baum-Welch algorithm could estimate probabilities and parameters using a little more information than the results of the hidden Markov chain.

 Users posting tweets: \(4.6k\) requests/sec on average, \(12k+\) requests/sec at peak. Users viewing timelines: \(300k\) requests/sec.  Twitter&#39;s scaling challenge is the fan-out: each user follows many people and each user is followed by many people.</description>

There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&#39;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read.</description>

      <description>The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)

New Caledonian crows make hooked tools from soft twigs to scoop insects out of holes. Other animals that use tools: chimpanzees, parrots, alligators and crabs.
The crows found the desired stems even when they had been disguised with leaves from a different plant species.
There are anecdotes of crow intelligence too, e.g. using cars at a crosslight to crush cashews in Japan (more in this HN thread)</description>

Scott&#39;s thesis: Each of the therapy books on their own can be convincing. But they should be taken in the context of All Therapy Books, which as a category are pretty worrying.
Dodo Bird Verdict: All psychotherapies are about equally good, and the only things that matters are &amp;ldquo;nonspecific factors&amp;rdquo; like how much patients like their therapist.</description>

I&#39;ve got a few problems though that I thought you might be able to help with? Sometimes I put the wrong information in a list item. Maybe to prevent this I&#39;d be able to modify/update the list item? That&#39;s not the only problem though, when there are 50+ items it gets kind of hard to work my way through.</description>

 Smooshed Morse code means Morse code with the spaces or other delimiters between encoded letters left out. See this week&#39;s Easy challenge for more detail. A permutation of the alphabet is a 26-character string in which each of the letters a through z appears once. Given a smooshed Morse code encoding of a permutation of the alphabet, find the permutation it encodes, or any other permutation that produces the same encoding (in general there will be more than one).</description>

Growing big antlers requires lots of Ca and Ph, which are rare. Small antlers were required to survive low-food winters, but big antlers were required to impress females to mate. The Irish elk spiraled to extinction.
I get the analogy that Housel is trying to paint, but this seems like an oversimplification. Sure, big antlers are sexy, but if small antlers are all that&#39;s left on the menu, I doubt female antlers will think &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Seeing government influence through coordination of sensitive coverage, localization of negative news &amp;amp; crowding out other stories on the front page.
Structural topic models (LDA + context, e.g. topic prevalence, choice of words) analyze fundamental aspect of the news that can&#39;t be changed.

      <description>OCR tends to miss (sometimes) really important context.
Make use of derived data, e.g. age at marriage, gender differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names
Don&#39;t spend all your time cleaning data.
Try a sequence of things, not one big idea.
Don&#39;t expect existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not as straightforward.

Irrational numbers occupy most of the number line. If you were to pick a number on the number line at random, there is literally a 100% chance that it will be irrational (probabilities with inifinities are spooky). Yet, we almost never encounter irrational numbers for we can&#39;t write them down.
The shapes we know best - lines, parabolas, circles, spheres - are the needles, for they can be expressed by simple equations.</description>

Soon your great idea loses its appeal.

 Watch out for the tendency to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world should be. If you think the world is all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about intuitively.  If you think the world is all data, you&#39;ll miss how much is too complicated to summarize in a statistic.</description>

The printing press sparked the Age of Reason. However, a world reliant on data &amp;amp; algorithms, uncontrollable by ethical/philosophical norms will upend the Age of Reason. The people developing AI care more about technical feats than ethical/philosophical issues.

Most introductionary implementations for testing the primality of a number have a time complexity of $ O(\sqrt{n}) $. For large numbers this is not a feasible strategy, for example testing a 400 digit number. Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem states:
 If $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$, the number $a^p ‚àí a$ is an integer multiple of $p$
 This can also be stated as: $a^p \mod p = a$.</description>

      <description>Description Link to original problem
In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. The most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.
The initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state.</description>

Change by itself is hard. Investors have to spot it before it&#39;s obvious. Consumers have to change their behaviors to make it viable. These two points repel each other.
Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>

A random process is ergodic if all of its statistics can be determined from a sample function of the process. That is, the ensemble averages equal the corresponding time averages with probability one.
Role of Ergodicity in Human Inference  A newspaper has previously printed some inaccurate information, therefore, the newspaper is going to publish inaccurate information in the future.</description>

Keeping the exchange rate fixed requires governments to nudge the rate, e.g.
 Use reserves of foreign currency to buy up their own currency Set high interest rates to entice lenders to buy their currency  Margaret Thatcher (PM) opposed the fixed exchange rates but lost the vote to Major, an ERM proponent.</description>

Choosing a bullshit minimizing path is error-prone. Your priorities change over time. Periodically evaluate where you are. It helps to have measurable aspects of your life.</description>

Growth mindset: people who believe effort - and not ability - determines success are more resilient, skillful, hard-working, perseverant in the face of failure.
Most of the growth mindset experiments prime their subjects, but recent priming experiments have famously failed to replicate. Dweck&#39;s experiment:
 Group A: easy test (success) -&amp;gt; final bound-to-fail test Group B: hard test (told they&#39;re not working hard enough) -&amp;gt; final bound-to-fail test Group B outperformed Group A.</description>

Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &amp;lsquo;do everything&amp;rsquo;, but often they mean &amp;lsquo;do everything that‚Äôs reasonable.&amp;rsquo; But they may not know what‚Äôs reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish.</description>
