      <description>Techno-utopianism claimed that the old ways of doing things are broken, and technology is the panacea: ending poverty, fixing racism, equalizing opportunity, strengthening democracy; toppling authoritarian regimes.
Disruptive, wealthy and apolitical innovators were/are the heroes, and not the tech activists, e.g. the late Aaron Swartz.
However, the conversation has shifted to techno-dystopianism: humans losing jobs, loss of privacy, radicalization, etc.
But both techno-utopianism and techno-dystopianism are too facile and simplistic outlooks.</description>

      <description>Holmes had an all-star team: Larry Ellison&amp;rsquo;s mentor as Chair, Associate Dean of Stanford&amp;rsquo;s School of Engineering, 30 years IBM experience, 25 years pharma and biotech experience, Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s chip-making subsidiary head&amp;hellip;
Fraud or not, this is a sick lineup! How could she mess this up?
  Big Pharma spends tens of $B on clinical trials each year. Theranos would enable them to adjust dosage and save 30%. Holmes insisted on revising financial projections upward - assuming all (15+) deals came through - to $1.</description>

      <description>Quiz It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give pessimistic answers when the book&amp;rsquo;s title says &amp;ldquo;Things Are Better Than You Think&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
    In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?
üî≤‚ÄÖA: 20 percent
‚ùå‚ÄÖB: 40 percent
‚úÖ‚ÄÖC: 60 percent
There has been lots of efforts to get girls to finish primary school, e.g. providing sanitary towels. Surely, they must be at \( \ge 40% \) completion rates.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Tipping Point is the biography of how little things had big effects.
From 1992 to 1997, murder rates dropped 64.3% to 770 and total crimes fell by \(\approx\) 50% to 355,893.
Geometric progressions are non-intuitive, e.g. if given a large paper and asked to fold it 50x, the stack&amp;rsquo;s height will be \(\approx\) the distance to the sun.
This is a popular illustration. The standard paper&amp;rsquo;s thickness, \(h_0\), is \(0.</description>

      <description>You need to develop a broad spectrum of style and then be able to move from one end of the spectrum to the other as occasion demands. You&amp;rsquo;ll develop a basic style but inability to diversify is being like a baller with a drive but no jump shot. Questions to ask: What am I writing about? Who will read what I&amp;rsquo;ve written? Why did I write it?   I&amp;rsquo;m writing about topics that I want to know more about.</description>

      <description>The order of learning: the necessary, the useful, the ornamental.
A teacher&amp;rsquo;s duty is to show the student what he can do for themselves and how to do it.
Knowing how to study is especially important because college can only cover so much. Furthermore, a student&amp;rsquo;s career requirements may change.
Nothing is true simply because it is in a book. It must pass the test of one&amp;rsquo;s understanding. In case the understanding is beyond the student, they must perceive whether it&amp;rsquo;s mere fact, definition or opinion.</description>

      <description>The Principle Brandolini&amp;rsquo;s Bullshit Asymmetry Principle: The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it. 
In Essence of Bullshit  , Frankfurt posits that the essence of bullshit is lack of concern for the truth, which may explain why bullshit is easier to produce.
  Jonathan Swift: Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv&amp;rsquo;d, it is too late; the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>To classify something, find things that are similar and label it with the same class as the most similar thing.
The feature space is \(N-d\), where \(N\) is the number of features. Each instance is mapped to a point. The descriptive features become the axes.
The Similarity Metric Mathematically, it must conform to these 4 criteria:
 Non-negative: \(f(a, b) \ge 0\) Identity: \( f(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b \) Symmetry: \( f(a, b) = f(b, a) \) Triangular inequality: \( f(a, b) \le f(a, c) + f(c, b) \)  Why are non-negativity and triangular inequality important?</description>

Young Jimmy independently arrived at Zeno&amp;rsquo;s Paradox, and concluded that the family car should never need gas.
Reminds me of an anecdote a friend told me about intern interviews for one of the big banks. Something like, if you keep moving half the distance, how many moves do you need to make in order to touch some object? The expected answer was impossible, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy it.</description>

      <description>Fall 1990. Simons had spent 12 years searching for a successful investing formula. In 1989, his net returns were -4.0%. In 1988, he had netted 9.0%. In 1990, he netted 55.0% (77.8% before fees).
With Elywn Berlekamp, game theorist professor at UCB, Simons built a model for selecting idea trades based on data.
Berlekamp knew their approach was alchemic - no cash flows, interest rate forecasts, product research. Some of the trade recommendations didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.</description>

      <description>The access patterns for a data system (e.g. database, cache, etc.) motivate different implementations, and thus performance characteristics.
Because many applications have a wide range of requirements, single tools no longer meet all of the data processing and storage needs. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the application to stitch together different tools.
Despite the behind-the-scenes stitching, the data system may provide certain guarantees, e.g. the cache will be correctly invalidated.</description>

      <description>Classifying mathematics by its subject matter may be misleading because the kinds of questions being asked may be the same, despite different subject matter.
Does it then imply that questions in math can be approached through any technique, but some techniques are simply more efficient than others?
  Nonetheless, classifying by subject matter, we crudely have algebra, geometry and analysis.
Algebra vs. Geometry It&amp;rsquo;s insufficient to claim that algebra contains symbols, while arithmetic contains numbers.</description>

      <description>Random walk: future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. Thus, short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable.
Investing as a Way of Life Today Difference between speculations and investments: time period and predictability of the return.
To stay even, your returns must match inflation (averaged 4% from 1962 to 2018).
With regard to beating inflation, that implies all the money that&amp;rsquo;s in people&amp;rsquo;s bank accounts is depreciating, as opposed to maintaining value.</description>

      <description>The goal is to make large datasets safe, i.e. no harm to you from having your data included.
Sanitize and Transfer Model Remove all PII, _e.g. name, SSN, mobile number, etc, before releasing the dataset.
However, the list of PII is not necessarily complete. Furthermore, combinations of seemingly non-PII data can be jointly identifying.
Using an auxilliary dataset is a common re-identification method, e.g. Narayanan and Shmatikov [2010]   combined IMDB ratings and comments to deanonymize a Netflix dataset.</description>

      <description>Holmes wanted to be a billionaire since childhood. Her parents were from wealth, with medical and military folk. Holmes attended Houston&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious private school. She spoke her way into Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Mandarin program, while still in high school. Parents insisted on living a purposeful life.
Worked in lab during school year. Freshman internship at Genome Institute of Singapore: nasal swabs and syringes. There had to be a better way.
Ah, the transformative experience abroad.</description>

      <description>Night Ride - April 18, 1775 Paul Revere and William Dawes.
Revere alerted influential militia leaders on his ride to Lexington.
Led to American forces winning the first battle of the Revolutionary War.
Malcolm Gladwel describes Paul Revere as a &amp;ldquo;Connector&amp;rdquo; in The Tipping Point    Medici Family in Renaissance Florence 15 prominent families
Medici had 50% higher degree than Strozzi and Guadagni.
But the Medicis influential power was much greater than explained by the 50%.</description>

      <description>Bernoulli Process A Bernoulli Process is a sequence of independent \({0, 1}\) - valued random variables \(X_1, X_2, X_3, &amp;hellip;\), e.g. \(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1\)
A Bernoulli Process does not mandate that the probability distributions of the \(X_i\) be identical. That is up to the model that we choose. For instance, the Binomial Random Variable assumes \(\mathbb{P}\{X_i = 1\} = p \ \ \forall i\)
  Suppose you flip a coin repeatedly, and record \(0\) for tails and \(1\) for heads.</description>

      <description>\(X\) is a binomial random variable if it takes the values \(0, 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, n\) and
$$ \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = { n \choose k } \cdot p^k \cdot (1 - p)^{n-k} $$
Sanity Check: Do the probabilities sum to 1? $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} { n \choose k } p^k (1 - p)^{n-k} = \left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n = 1 $$
I totally didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how we got to \(\left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n\).</description>

      <description>The Midnight Ride  Afternoon of April 18, 1775: Paul Revere, a silversmith, got word of British planning to raise hell the next day.
Revere goes out informing people. Churchbells and drums. Those informed by Revere send out riders of their own.
In Concord, the colonial militia soundly beat the British, kicking off the American Revolution.
Wiliam Dawes also had a ride. But the local militia leaders weren&amp;rsquo;t alerted. Few people came out to fight the British.</description>

Observing Only noticing things that most affect you leads to thin development, sketchy generalizations and excessive subjectivity.

      <description>The Proper Use of Humility Confessing your fallibility but doing nothing about it braggery, not humility. Designing fail-safe machinery is good humility. Dismissing evidence for evolution because we can&amp;rsquo;t really know for sure that evolution is correct is misplaced humility.
The Third Alternative Sometimes we justify questionable policy by claiming its absence is undesirable, e.g. believing in Santa makes children behave nicely, and therefore Santa-ism is the best of all possible alternatives.</description>

Unlike English grammar that can be ambiguous, mathematical grammar is precise.

      <description>A fault is when a component deviates from its spec, while a failure is when the system no longer provides the required service to the user.
Better to design fault-tolerant systems because we can&amp;rsquo;t reduce the probability of a fault to zero.
In fault-tolerant systems, one should trigger faults deliberately in order to test the tolerance, e.g. randomly killing individual processes.
However, not all things can be tolerated. For instance, if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, then the damage can&amp;rsquo;t be undone.</description>

      <description>Topic 2: Shell Tools.  https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/  .  Unlike other scripting programming languages, shell scripting is optimized for shell related tasks, e.g. reading from STDIN and saving results into files are primitives.
At the cost of being painful on the eyes. Python scripts are way more readable (and cross-platform) than shell scripts.

      <description>The Tulip Bulb Craze Virus causes colored stripes in tulip petals. The Dutch valued such bulbs. Prices rose (just when one thought they couldn&amp;rsquo;t go higher). Let the tulipmania begin.

      <description>Holmes insisted on using just a prick of blood. Problem: unreproducible results. A miniaturized catridge made storing and using the reagents hard.
You can&amp;rsquo;t Steve Jobs your way through medical devices. But you can&amp;rsquo;t change the world by being cynical.
  Costs. Each cartridge cost +$200 to make and was single use. Holmes even purchased a $2m automated packaging line.

      <description>The Subject The number of words aren&amp;rsquo;t intuitive to me. Adults tend to read non-fiction at 238 words per minute.  So a good test for how appropriate a piece of writing is, &amp;ldquo;Can the writer cover X in N minutes?&amp;rdquo;
Hugo uses 213 WPM, while Medium uses 265 WPM, suggesting Medium has a bias for skimming over close reading. 
I wonder if a browser extension that rates the appropriateness of articles given their subject and their word count is a feasible/desirable thing.</description>

      <description>More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.
Why is this cause of disaster so common?  Our estimation techniques assume that all will go well, i.e. each task will take only as long as it &amp;ldquo;ought&amp;rdquo; to take. Our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are interchangeable. Because we are uncertain of our estimates, software managers often lack the courteous stubbornness - if you&amp;rsquo;re made to wait, it is to serve you better, and to please you.</description>

      <description>Similarity-based learning is intuitive and gives people confidence in the model.
There is an inductive bias that instances that have similar descriptive features belong to the same class.
Remarkably so. When I think of classifying things, my mind immediately goes to NN.
  Similarity learning has a stationary assumption, i.e. the joint PDF of the data doesn&amp;rsquo;t change (new classifications do not come up). This assumption is shared by supervised ML.</description>

Universa, a hedge fund made to exploit black swans, made 3,612% in March 2020 amidst the coronavirus crisis. Taleb is an advisor on the fund.  However, on a &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; day, Universa is always losing money.

      <description>Gathering evidence IRL may be expensive. When picking a stopping point, ask whether the collected evidence compels the conclusion, not whether it allows the conclusion.
Check your motivations. Are you ignoring fast cheap evidence because you already have a comfortable conclusion? Are you holding out for expensive slow evidence because the conclusion is uncomfortable?
A probabilistic model can take a few hits. But we sometimes assume a true theory can have no failures and a false theory can have no success.</description>

      <description>Discover the Fundamental Idea It helps you master the subject because the other details can be viewed in relation to the fundamental idea.
Facts of secondary importance may then be left for later readings.
Fundamental principles should frequently be memorized.
Lay Out Pre-Existing Knowledge Classify what you already know [and what you don&amp;rsquo;t know].
If you know nothing, insist on getting a clear idea of the subject, its extent, objects, methods, applications and relations to other subjects.</description>

      <description>Motivation In 08. A New Walking Shoe: Modern Portfolio Theory   , Malkiel introduced me to Modern Portfolio Theory, a technique for reducing portfolio risk, despite risky investments. It made me wonder how similar principles are applied in agriculture. This page is the result of that investigation.
~16% of Kenya&amp;rsquo;s land is sufficiently fertile and has good rainfall. In 2006, ~75% of working Kenyans are farmers (compared to 80% in 1980).</description>

      <description>For some terminated employees, Holmes requested a dossier on them for leverage. Mosley (finance guy) had stored porn on his work laptop. Holmes (retroactively) used that as the cause for his termination and lack of stock options.
Matt (IT) wanted to leave to start IT consulting firm. Holmes asking him to use ununionized (mob controlled) movers for a last minute move from East Paly was one of the final straws. Holmes tried asking Matt&amp;rsquo;s peer to build dossier in exchange for Matt&amp;rsquo;s position, but they declined.</description>

      <description>Models state transitions through differential equations over continuous time \(t\). Commonly used to model the spread of diseases.
Possible states that proportions of the population could be in at time \(t\) are: susceptible \(S(t)\), infected \(I(t)\), and recovered \(R(t)\)
The SI Model Assumes that one can only move from state \(S\) to state \(I\), with probability \(\beta\).
$$ S&#39;(t) = - \beta S(t) I(t);\ \ \ \ I&#39;(t) = \beta S(t) I(t) $$</description>

      <description>Majority Voting The \(k\) nearest neighbors model predicts the target level from the majority vote from the set of the \(k\) nearest neighbors to the query \(q\).
Where \(\delta\) is an indicator function such that \(\delta(t_i, l) = 1 \iff t_i = l\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k} (q) = argmax_{l \in levels(t)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \delta(t_i, l) \right) $$
For categorical features, \(k\) should be odd to avoid ties.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t read right. If there are 3 possible categories, \(k = 3\) can result in a tie.</description>

      <description>Beginnings Your shot at intriguing or acclimating the reader. Establish the tone, stylistic manner and attitude in the first few sentences.
The Direct Beginning State the subject in the first sentence, and the thesis in the first paragraph.
Use the first paragraph to define subject or a quick synopsis of the material to come.
The Delayed Beginning An attention-getting device, e.g. anecdote, generalization, vivid description, dramatic incident, paradoxical observation, can serve as the background to your thesis.</description>

Study a few subjects at once, but not too many. The mind needs change of occupation, not idleness.
Weigh carefully before taking up or dropping a study. Read much but not many books.
Fix your mind intensely on one thing for a time long enough to make progress.

I think for the general population, the value of privacy is not worth the inconvenience associated with securing it, in the cases where it&amp;rsquo;s not readily availed by Big Tech. For example, one wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go out of their way to not have passwords and 2FA. However, when it comes to matters like online privacy, most folks are willing to allow surveillance in exchange for free services like web search, social media, etc.</description>

      <description>When you have features taking different range if values, you may have odd predictions.
For example, if \(f_1 \in [0, 100]\) and \(f_2 \in [0, 1]\), \(f_1\) will always be penalized more than \(f_2\) when computing the distance.
  To mitigate this, normalize the feature&amp;rsquo;s ranges to \([r_{low}, r_{high}]\):
$$ a&#39;_i = \frac{a_i - a_{min}}{ a_{max} - a_{min}} \cdot (r_{high} - r_{low}) + r_{low} $$
Typically, the range is normalized to \([r_{low}, r_{high}] = [0, 1]\), so range normalization simplifies to:</description>

      <description>The Formula By definition&amp;hellip;
$$ \mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A \cap B) + \mathbb{P}(A \cap B^{c}) $$
From conditional probability   &amp;hellip;
$$ \mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A|B) \ \mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A|B^c) \ \mathbb{P}(B^c) $$
Therefore
$$ \mathbb{P}(B|A) = \frac{ \mathbb{P}(B \cap A) }{ \mathbb{P}(A) } $$ $$ = \frac{ \mathbb{P}(A|B) \mathbb{P}(B) }{ \mathbb{P}(A|B) \ \mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A|B^c) \ \mathbb{P}(B^c) } $$

      <description>Is There Momentum in the Stock Market? Past stock prices cannot be used reliably to foretell future movements. Furthermore, transactions costs and taxes make it hard to exploit any short-term momentum.
Flip a fair coin many times. Sequences of heads (or tails) and jumbled up sequences occur with equal probability.

      <description>Return the Average Value One possible solution is to return the average value in the neighborhood, i.e.
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i $$
We can improve this by using weighted \(k-NN\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} \cdot t_i \right) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} } $$
The formula looks new. However, if \(x_1\) is weighted by \(w_1\) and \(x_2\) by \(w_2\), then the weighted average is:
$$ \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 }{w_1 + w_2} $$</description>

      <description>Return the Average Value One possible solution is to return the average value in the neighborhood, i.e.
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i $$
We can improve this by using weighted \(k-NN\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} \cdot t_i \right) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} } $$
The formula looks new. However, if \(x_1\) is weighted by \(w_1\) and \(x_2\) by \(w_2\), then the weighted average is:
$$ \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 }{w_1 + w_2} $$</description>

Rereading your own prose will not always disclose gaps since you may unconsciously fill them.
The Devices of Momentum Make sure that a strand of an idea runs through the paragraph and the composition.

      <description>Fundamentalists tout past earnings growth as a most reliable indicator of future growth. But academics have shown that past earnings growth are no help in predicting future growth.
Why is the Crystal Ball So Clouded?  Many of the influential changes that affect earnings prospects are unpredictable. Creative accounting procedures produce dubious reported earnings, e.g. pro forma earnings, pushing due payments to future years, etc. Analysts may make errors, e.g. over-estimating the market size.</description>

      <description>The miniLab, 4S for short, stemmed from the need for a device that could perform more than just one class of tests. Theranos value prop was now minituarization, as opposed to invention. Current blood analyzers used too much blood and did too few tests.
Kent, de-facto Chief Architect of the miniLab, had raised $215k on Kickstarter for his bike lights side project. Elizabeth and Sunny wanted the patent to be transferred to Theranos.</description>

      <description>The mystical perfect risk measure is still beyond our grasp. That said, here are some common ones:
Beta and Systematic Risk Systematic risk of a security arises from the variability of the general stock market. Diversification does not reduce this risk.
Unsystematic risk is the remaining variability that is due to a company&amp;rsquo;s particular factors, e.g. a strike. Diversification reduces this risk. There is no reason for extra compensation.
Beta is a measure of the systematic risk.</description>

Theranos would courier samples to Palo Alto for testing. Theranos used a lancet on the index finger AND the good old hypodermic needle to the arm. The results could take 2 weeks as opposed to near-instantaneous. Theranos&amp;rsquo;s results tended to be way off, unless they had been outsourced.</description>

      <description>Behavioralists believe that:
 Investors are not rational in present and future valuations of securities. There are substantial barriers to efficient arbitrage.  The Irrational Behavior of Individual Investors Overconfidence People tend to be overconfident, e.g. in a survey, 94% of male respondents believed that their athleticism was above average.
Hindsight bias makes the world seem predictable. Investors might think they can beat the market.
The tendency of &amp;ldquo;growth&amp;rdquo; stocks to underperform &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; stocks shows how overoptimistic growth forecasts are.</description>

      <description>Elizabeth had successfully pitched to James Mattis, 4-star General, about deploying Theranos in Afghanistan. General Mattis was known to look out for his troops.
Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s plan around regulation - the real blood analysis would be beamed to California to be done by professionals; only the CLIA compliance for the Palo Alto lab was needed - no FDA.
Lt. Col. Shoemaker, responsible for the army&amp;rsquo;s compliance with medical regulations, was openly critical of the Theranos&#39; workaround.</description>

      <description>Smart Beta Using relatively passive-rule based strategies to gain greater than market returns without assuming more risk than investing in a low-cost total stock market index fund.
The Sharpe Ratio: (excess return over the risk-free rate) / (risk of the strategy). The risk-free rate is usually the return from a 3-month treasury bill. Higher Sharpe Ratios are better.
Smart beta argues that pure indexing (weighting by market cap) is not optimal.</description>

David Boies was legendary: antitrust against MSFT, Al Gore on contested 2000 election, overturning ban on gay marriage in CA. He also intimidated opponents with private investigators.

Ian confided in Channing Robertson, who parroted to Elizabeth, who fired Ian.
But his colleagues lobbied him back in. He was in a demoted position though. Paul, previous mentee turned manager, was more compromising with the engineers.
Ian was dismayed that Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s name was usually in 1st place on patents despite negligible scientific contribution.</description>

      <description>Chiat\Day was the agency that Apple had used. Therefore, Theranos would too.
Patrick (Chiat\Day) was enamored by Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s mission. The website models featured all demographics. Elizabeth scheduled Wednesday meetings because that&amp;rsquo;s how Apple did it.
Stan Fiorito (Chiat\Day) was more circumspect. Sunny&amp;rsquo;s sales targets had measly research. How were they affording $6m/year retainer?
Elizabeth claimed Theranos was saving soldiers&#39; lives in Afghanistan. She wanted bold claims:

2.5 years of the miniLab&amp;rsquo;s development. But it was still a work in progress. In medical device standards, 3 years is a short time.
Sycophants were promoted. Many employees were on H1-B, so they needed Theranos&amp;rsquo;s employment.

A test is considered precise if its coefficient of variation (CV) is below 10%. Data runs that failed to meet the threshold were discarded. Of six values, Theranos only reported the median to the patient.

Richard agreed to withdraw patent in exchange for Theranos withdrawing its suit. The Fuiszes had lost. But Joe demanded a public apology from Theranos.
Roger Parloff, Fortune Magazine&amp;rsquo;s legal correspondent saw the settlement in Litigation Daily. After speaking to Shultz, Perry, Kissinger, Nunn, Mattis and the 2 new directors: Kovacevich (former Wells Fargo CEO) and Frist (former Senate majority leader), came the June 2014 cover story that catapulted Elizabeth to fame: This CEO Is Out for Blood.</description>

The thread showed Sunny admonishing Alan &amp;amp; Mark for running proficiency tests on the Edison and admitting that the device had &amp;ldquo;failed&amp;rdquo; the test. Elizabeth was copied on most of the emails.
Carreyrou tracked Carmen Washington, who had complained about Theranos&amp;rsquo;s blood tests in Walgreens. 3 of her patients had received questionable test results.</description>

      <description>Charlotte: I doubt if Theranos&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;box&amp;rsquo; is real. Henry [Kissinger] doubts too and he&amp;rsquo;s been saying he wants out.
Tyler got served with an affidavit stating that he&amp;rsquo;d never spoken to any third parties about Theranos and that he&amp;rsquo;d give names of [ex]employees who he knew had talked to WSJ.
George: Tyler isn&amp;rsquo;t a snitch. Finding out who spoke to WSJ is Theranos&amp;rsquo;s problem.

      <description>Carreyrou &amp;amp; WSJ vs. Boies Schiller The Boies Schiller delegation was led by David Boies himself!
Admissions: Ownership of commercial blood analyzers; problematic potassium test was a known issue, and no faulty results had been released to patients.
Siemens ADVIA? Special dilution on ADVIA? Number of tests done by the Edison? Trade secret!
Boies Schiller and witnesses Tyler was young and unqualified; disgruntled ex-employees are unreliable.

Eventually, when enough [tuna] had gathered around them, someone gave and imperceptible signal and in a split second the scene went from preternatural quiet to gory bloodbath as the fishermen struck viciously at their unsuspecting quarry.</description>

      <description>Rupert Murdoch led the most recent $430m funding round with $125m. He followed his gut: he&amp;rsquo;d invested $150k in Uber for it to become $50m.
The investment packket forecasted (profit revenue) of ($330m, $1b) in 2015 and ($505m, $2b) in 2016. Furthermore, Theranos had lined up Cox Enterprises, The Waltons, New England Patriots owner, Carlos Slim, controller of Fiat Chrysler.
Elizabeth brought up Carreyrou&amp;rsquo;s story to Murdoch, but Murdoch declined to intervene - saying he trusted the paper&amp;rsquo;s editors to handle the matter fairly.</description>

      <description>[3 weeks before first article] Erika Cheung&amp;rsquo;s email to Gary Yamamoto (CMS) spurred the surprise inspection on Theranos&amp;rsquo;s labs in less than 3 days. They found so many problems and missing documentation that they planned to return. When they returned, WSJ&amp;rsquo;s article was out and there was pressure. CMS released a letter calling Theranos an &amp;ldquo;immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety&amp;rdquo;.
Theranos claimed to have fixed many of the deficiencies, and that the problems had no bearing on the soundness of its proprietary tech.</description>

To resolve SEC&amp;rsquo;s civil charges, Elizabeth was forced to relinquish her voting control, give back a big chunk of stock, pay a $500k penalty and not be an officer/director in a public company for 10 years.
Sunny didn&amp;rsquo;t join Theranos until late 2009. Elizabeth had already been misleading pharmaceutical companies for years about the readiness of her tech.</description>

      <description>Intent A one-to-many dependency between object so that when one object (subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and update automatically.
A meta-point is that while we could achieve consistency by making the classes tightly coupled, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that because tight coupling reduces reusability.
What are the tradeoffs between the observer design pattern, and having the observer pass callbacks to the subject?
  Sample Code An abstract class defines the Observer interface:</description>

Notable Plot Points Prodded by Haber to dream of the end of overpopulation, Orr dreamt of a plague that killed 6B people. But Orr tries to convince himself that the world that was was fiction in his head, so he didn&amp;rsquo;t really kill anyone.</description>

The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of Engineers.

      <description>Motivated by the markup done by LensCrafters    Terms like &amp;ldquo;medical-grade&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;military-grade&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;organic&amp;rdquo; often make consumers over-estimate the products&#39; good qualities. Sometimes the test itself is too easy to pass.
For instance, &amp;ldquo;military-grade&amp;rdquo; comes from specs by the military to enable interchangeability between manufacturers. Saying something is military-grade without quoting some mil-spec, e.g. shock tests, is bogus.  
Costco Kirkland is more likely to be high quality because Costco demands it from the supplier.</description>

      <description>The Problem of Twelve: In the near future, roughly 12 individuals will have practical power over majority of US public companies.
A Short History of Corporations  In the first stage, entrepreneurs get money from savings, &amp;ldquo;friends, family, and fools&amp;rdquo;, and VCs. Securities law restricts this to sophisticated investors only.
On generating revenue and stability, the entrepreneur takes the firm public (IPO) under oversight from the SEC. Ownership is separated from control, e.</description>

      <description>Retained Mode vs. Immediate Mode In retained mode, the graphics library exposes an API to the application for building/updating a scene. However, the graphics library is in charge of issuing drawing commands. In contrast, an immediate-mode API allows the application to issue the drawing commands. Retained-mode APIs abstract away initialization, state maintenance and cleanup, but uses more memory. Immediate-mode APIs allow for more targeted optimizations. 
https://reactjs.org/ is one of the more popular retained-mode web APIs.</description>

With relative cursors, we have URLs like example.com/items?limit=50&amp;amp;lastID=XXX, which leads to SQL like SELECT * from &#39;items&#39; WHERE &#39;id&#39; &amp;gt; XXX ORDER BY &#39;id&#39; ASC LIMIT 50, and this is more efficient, assuming there are indexes for id.</description>

Some (most?) of these claims are supported by anecdotal evidence, which is an avenue for belief fixation, and therefore makes it hard to come to a resolution  .
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because anti-PC material is more viral, but most of the prominent publications are either anti-PC, or anti-anti-PC.</description>

      <description>Consultants are not well suited for strategy (you probably have a deeper understanding). They are also an expensive way of proving your point to management. However, they are good for emergency horsepower, e.g. data analysis, and for primary research within your industry (they probably have a broader understanding). 
Having a competitive advantage may reduce the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking.</description>

      <description>Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&amp;rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&amp;rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy. 
Slots are increasingly designed for addiction, e.g. quick simple games, adding &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo;, more ways to win (and therefore more &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo; if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t bet on the additional ways), losses disguised as wins, random but weighted outcomes.</description>

One [intuitive] derivation is presented at brilliant.org :
$$ S_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + &amp;hellip; + n $$

      <description>Exercise 1: Have a regular savings program. Start investing early because compound interest and time are you greatest resource.
When it comes to setting saving accounts&#39; interest rates   with regard to the interest rate that banks enjoy from the fed   , banks are downwards-flexible and upwards-sticky. Depositors lose the tune of $100b when interest rates are rising.

      <description>What determines the returns from stocks and bonds? A stock buyer expects a growing stream of dividends. If the company re-invests its profits, the stock buyer expects more rapidly growing dividends in the future, or a lucrative stock buyback.
Long-run Equity Return = Initial Dividend Yield + Growth Rate
In the short run (e.g. a year) the changes in price/dividend or price/earnings multiples determine returns. In optimistic times, e.g. March 2000, P/E &amp;gt; 30 and P/D &amp;gt; 80.</description>

      <description>Mergeable Replicated Data Types  On a distributed system, each replica should [eventually] converge to the same state. Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) can accept updates and achieve consistent without remote synchronization.
The Need for Commutativity Say we have a queue \( 1 \to 2 \). Suppose two replicas, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), independently call pop(). Each replica will have \(2\) on their queue.
However, on receiving an update that the other replica popped, each replica will call pop() to be consistent, thereby deleting \(2\).</description>

      <description>Contact Tracing &amp;ldquo;Apps&amp;rdquo; in this context means contact tracing apps released by public health authorities to do contact tracing. The APIs are limited to them.
  Big Picture Release APIs to enable apps to interoperate between Android and iOS devices. Bluetooth-based contact tracing baked into Android and iOS, such that no app is needed for broadcasting/listening.  This ensures broad adoption, but will be on an opt-in basis.</description>

      <description>Harden, a liberal behavior geneticist, is publishing a book, &amp;ldquo;The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality&amp;rdquo;.  Watch this space as it casts doubt on prevailing social justice thesis that environmental factors, and not genetics, influence behavior or social outcomes.

      <description>Choose your content. Some material not worth the effort. Learning comes from repetition, but sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. 
But even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. 
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions. Make flashcards of facts/quotes that you wish to analyze.</description>

      <description>Short Selling  Say $A shares are selling at $100, but I think they&amp;rsquo;re overpriced. So I borrow 10 shares, pay my brokerage interest and post some collateral. I then sell the shares for $1,000.
Whoever buys my shares has no idea that I do not own them. In a naked short, I do not actually borrow or ensure that the security can be borrowed within the standard 3-day settlement period.</description>

      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &amp;ldquo;Life After Hate&amp;rdquo; suggested to them. 
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?</description>

Admittedly, these are things that the government should be doing, but it seems that the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t do enough. Furthermore, some of these issues so politicized, e.g. immigrants, that government support can be fickle.

      <description>Protectionism vs. Globalization Prestige Ameritech is America&amp;rsquo;s #1 maker of surgical masks. In outbreaks, demand peaks, but when it&amp;rsquo;s all over, hospitals go back to exclusively buying cheaper masks from China. Reduced demand makes Ameritech lay off workers. Ameritech is pushing for a federal contract to stabilize demand over time.

The Baum-Welch algorithm could estimate probabilities and parameters using a little more information than the results of the hidden Markov chain.

      <description>etfdb.com has ETFs tracking regions. Surprised that Kenya isn&amp;rsquo;t on it   . And they&amp;rsquo;re all losing money - best (over 5 years) is SA at -14.59%, Nigeria is at -64%   .   Why all the PR on Africa being the next big investment scene?  Of course, Kenya&amp;rsquo;s the premier investment destination (invest.go.ke)      Am I reading this right?? SOXL (semiconductors) ETF has &amp;gt;700% return over 5 years etfdb.</description>

      <description>Third Base  Not recognizing your blessings feeds into the dark side of capitalism and meritocracy: success is a choice, and that those who haven‚Äôt achieved success are not unlucky, but unworthy.
I&amp;rsquo;m relatively lucky. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much of the techie hubris that I bear. I have unresolved feelings about meritocracy and fairness. Race is usually used as a proxy for bridging the gap, e.g. affirmative action at colleges.</description>

 Dodo Bird Verdict   : All psychotherapies are about equally good, and the only things that matters are &amp;ldquo;nonspecific factors&amp;rdquo; like how much patients like their therapist.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few problems though that I thought you might be able to help with? Sometimes I put the wrong information in a list item.

Solution I&amp;rsquo;m used to problems where the resources are not depleted, e.g. I can use a as many times as I want. The trickiest part was keeping track of the substring indexes.</description>

BOGO goods are usually low-demand, non-efficient, lacking in quality and/or close to the expiration date.

The messages are quite brief, e.g. the ITCH protocol uses 32 bytes per message.
Trading firm listens to broadcasts on buys, sells, deletes on ITCH broadcasts. Online sorting to identify profitable trades.
Matching engine operates on a first-come-first-served basis. Earlier orders with better price get traded first.

      <description>OCR tends to miss (sometimes) really important context.
Make use of derived data, e.g. age at marriage, gender differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names
Don&amp;rsquo;t spend all your time cleaning data.
Try a sequence of things, not one big idea.
Don&amp;rsquo;t expect existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not as straightforward.

 FaceTime is preloaded, therefore 100% of users have it FaceTime wasn&amp;rsquo;t efficient in network usage. The capacity was asymmetrical, but video chat is symmetrical  Interestingly enough, AT&amp;amp;T required Apple to greenlight it, which they did.

      <description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. 
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting  74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description>

Sep 17, 2018.  Irrational numbers occupy most of the number line. If you were to pick a number on the number line at random, there is literally a 100% chance that it will be irrational (probabilities with inifinities are spooky). Yet, we almost never encounter irrational numbers for we can&amp;rsquo;t write them down.
The shapes we know best - lines, parabolas, circles, spheres - are the needles, for they can be expressed by simple equations.</description>

      <description>Immeasurably Important.  Morgan Housel. http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/  . Jul 5, 2018.  Filtering out information is an art, not a science, necessitated by the information overload that we live in.
 Watch out for the tendency to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world should be. If you think the world is all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about intuitively.  If you think the world is all data, you&amp;rsquo;ll miss how much is too complicated to summarize in a statistic.</description>

But every investor seems to be doing due diligence. The successful ones will be more convinced that their methods really work.

      <description>Description  Link to original problem   In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)   is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. The most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.</description>

Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>

 Grew up in poverty in a one-room house in small-town India. But a lot of poor people in the US had better conditions/opportunities  Either, a lot of intelligence is innate Or, those poor people are just not trying hard enough.</description>

People&amp;rsquo;s uncertainty about the consequences of privacy-related behaviors and their own preferences over those consequences Incomplete and asymmetric information. People rarely know what info others, firms and govts have about them or how the info is used.
Some privacy harms are tangible, e.g. financial costs associated with identity theft.</description>

      <description>10,000 Hours, YMMV  10,000 hours introduced here    10,000 hours has been lauded by popular authors, e.g. Malcolm Gladwel&amp;rsquo;s Outliers, and Geoff Colvin&amp;rsquo;s Talent is Overrated. Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &amp;ldquo;10,000 hours rule&amp;rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts. 
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.
A cross-sectional study is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population (or a representative subset) at a specific point in time.</description>

      <description>Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints. 
  Superior Perception Athletes outperformed novices when asked if there was a ball in a rapidly flashed slide.</description>

      <description>How Doctors Die.  Ken Murray. https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/ideas/nexus/  . Nov 30, 2011.  Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &amp;lsquo;do everything&amp;rsquo;, but often they mean &amp;lsquo;do everything that‚Äôs reasonable.&amp;rsquo; But they may not know what‚Äôs reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish.</description>

      <description>Method of Definition: Prototype Semantics There is a cognitive science view of categorization that says:
 Category members need not necessarily share a single set of distinguishing features, and may exhibit features to greater/lesser degrees Some category members are more typical than others  This reasoning goes against how I mentally picture a category.
  Although lies may have identifiable features such as misrepresentation of belief, intent to deceive, falseness and reprehensible motives, not all features are always present, and not all features are equally prominent in every instance.</description>

      <description>The Submarine.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html  . Apr 1, 2005.  Many people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come.</description>

      <description>Unfalsifiable but favorable propositions invite baloney. For example, one might want to believe in life after death, without being interested in evidence for it. However, one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t validate the pretensions of mediums on such a belief.
 The LeftOvers (TV Series)   explores this a bit. John pretends to be a medium, but actually has a hidden mic and earpiece to Laurie, who then searches the internet for details on the person of interest.</description>

      <description>Medical care is like the opposite of moving fast and breaking things. If it&amp;rsquo;s so taboo to admit error, then that could make errors more common because fewer people are learning from past errors.
  Norms for Scientific Activity and the Sources of Error &amp;ldquo;Science&amp;rdquo; is taken to mean &amp;ldquo;Natural Science&amp;rdquo;.
  Internal norms derive from a cognitive pursuit of science. They are:
 Focus on the central rather than the peripheral problems of the science in in question.</description>

      <description>But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in intensified form. The language becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easy for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible.
Standard phrases already have rhythm. They are a convenient shortcut for lazy communicators.
Pretentious diction to make the banal appear profound, the biased seem scientifically impartial and sordid events masquerade as dignified.</description>
