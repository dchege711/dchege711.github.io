An essay helps you figure something out. Think of it as an idea graph - at each node, pick the most interesting related idea. Expressing your ideas also helps you form them. Writing them down forces you to think well.

Disruptive, wealthy and apolitical innovators were/are the heroes, and not the tech activists, e.g. the late Aaron Swartz.
However, the conversation has shifted to techno-dystopianism: humans losing jobs, loss of privacy, radicalization, etc.
But both techno-utopianism and techno-dystopianism are too facile and simplistic outlooks.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/zuckerman-the-man-who-solved-the-market/part-0/00-introduction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/zuckerman-the-man-who-solved-the-market/part-0/00-introduction/</guid><description>Investor Key Fund/Vehicle Period Annualized Returns After Fees Jim Simons Medallion Fund 1988 ‚Äì 2018 (30) 39.1% George Soros Quantum Fund 1969 ‚Äì 2000 (31) 32.0% Steven Cohen SAC 1992 ‚Äì 2003 (11) 30.0% Peter Lynch Magellan Fund 1977 ‚Äì 1990 (13) 29.0% Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway 1965 ‚Äì 2018 (53) 20.5% Ray Dalio Pure Alpha 1991 ‚Äì 2018 (27) 12% But time in the market is king - at least that&amp;rsquo;s what Malkiel taught me.</description></item><item><title>An Overview of the World's Current State</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/socioeconomics/2020-03-14-how-well-do-you-know-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/socioeconomics/2020-03-14-how-well-do-you-know-the-world/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give pessimistic answers when &amp;rsquo;s title says &amp;ldquo;Things Are Better Than You Think&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;

A language model (LM) is a probability distribution over sequences of tokens. Suppose we have a vocabulary \(\mathcal{V}\) of a set of tokens, then a language model \(p\) assigns each sequence of tokens \(x_1, &amp;hellip;, x_L \in \mathcal{V} \) a probability.
To assign meaningful probabilities to all sequences requires syntactic knowledge and world knowledge.

A row can be uniquely identified by a table + ID combination. A column entry can reference another row in another table through a shared key. One goal is to avoid duplicating data. However, to answer a real-world query, we end up paying th cost by joining results from multiple tables. That said, with proper indexing and prior research, combining results is pretty fast.</description></item><item><title>Intro to Design Patterns</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/gang-of-four-design-patterns/intro-to-design-patterns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/gang-of-four-design-patterns/intro-to-design-patterns/</guid><description>What Are Design Patterns? Arriving at designs that are specific to the problem at hand but general enough to address future problems and requirements is hard. New designers tend to be overwhelmed by the options available. Expert designers do not solve every problem from first principles; they reuse design patterns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also encountered the &amp;ldquo;you aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna need it&amp;rdquo; (YAGNI) school of thought that aims to minimize writing code that anticipates too far into the future, as such guesses usually don&amp;rsquo;t pan out.</description></item><item><title>General Tips on Performance and Optimization</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/performance/general-tips/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/performance/general-tips/</guid><description>Trying to optimize may lead to errors and high-maintenance/change-resistant code. If there&amp;rsquo;s no need to optimize, let the code be.
Only optimize performance-critical parts of a program. If your program spends 4% of its processing time doing computation A, and 40% of its time doing computation B, a 50% improvement on A is only as impactful as a 5% improvement on B.

With regard to beating inflation, that implies all the money that&amp;rsquo;s in people&amp;rsquo;s bank accounts is depreciating, as opposed to maintaining value.</description></item><item><title>Motivation for Differential Privacy in Datasets</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/politics-and-governance/wws351-it-policy/07-privacy/differential-privacy/01-big-data-and-privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/politics-and-governance/wws351-it-policy/07-privacy/differential-privacy/01-big-data-and-privacy/</guid><description>The goal is to make large datasets safe, i.e. no harm to you from having your data included.
Sanitize and Transfer Model Remove all PII, _e.g. name, SSN, mobile number, etc, before releasing the dataset.
However, the list of PII is not necessarily complete. Furthermore, combinations of seemingly non-PII data can be jointly identifying.
Using an auxilliary dataset is a common re-identification method, e.g. Narayanan and Shmatikov [2010] combined IMDB ratings and comments to deanonymize a Netflix dataset.</description></item><item><title>Information and Technology Policy [WWS 351]</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/politics-and-governance/wws351-it-policy/_meta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/politics-and-governance/wws351-it-policy/_meta/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Privacy in CS and in the Law</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/cos432-information-security/14-privacy/01-privacy-in-cs-and-in-the-law/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/cos432-information-security/14-privacy/01-privacy-in-cs-and-in-the-law/</guid><description>Incomplete List of Information Privacy Properties Control/consent, e.g. Cambridge Analytica exfiltrating FB users' data Discussion on Cambridge Analytica Anonymity, e.g. Snowden leaking NSA docs without revealing his identity

A Bernoulli Process does not mandate that the probability distributions of the \(X_i\) be identical. That is up to the model that we choose. For instance, the Binomial Random Variable assumes \(\mathbb{P}\{X_i = 1\} = p \ \ \forall i\)

Better to design fault-tolerant systems because we can&amp;rsquo;t reduce the probability of a fault to zero.
In fault-tolerant systems, one should trigger faults deliberately in order to test the tolerance, e.g. randomly killing individual processes.
However, not all things can be tolerated. For instance, if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, then the damage can&amp;rsquo;t be undone.</description></item><item><title>02.

Andrew Yao generalized 2PC for any feasible computation in 1986. Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson later generalized it to secure multiparty communication.
Yao-based protocols requires that the function to be securely evaluated be represented as a circuit, but an efficient transformation is not trivial.</description></item><item><title>03.

They are untyped at compile time. The frequent casting from object and the actual type is error-prone; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to put the wrong type in the wrong collection.

printf Debugging and Logging In printf debugging, one adds print statements and keeps iterating until enough information has been extracted.
Using logging has several advantages over printf debugging: varying logging destinations (e.g. standard output, files, sockets, remote servers, etc.); severity levels (e.g. INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &amp;amp;c) that support filtering of output; color-coding for readability.

Abstractions and indirections in the name of future-proofing tend to be wrong especially when treading new paths, where you can&amp;rsquo;t reliably predict the future.</description></item><item><title>Resource Management in C++</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/resource-management/resource-management-cpp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/resource-management/resource-management-cpp/</guid><description>Resource Handles RAII is also covered in Classes in C++ &amp;gt; Motivation for the Destructor Mechanism The constructor/destructor pattern enables objects defined in a scope to release the resources during exit from the scope, even when exceptions are thrown.

The Four Color Theorem does not claim that 4 colors suffice to color a planar map. Instead, 4 colors are sufficient to color any planar graph so that no two vertices connected by an edge are colored with the same color.

They propose Cloak, which suppresses non-pertinent features (i.e. those features which can consistently tolerate addition of noise without degrading utility) to the prediction task. Cloak has a provable degree of privacy, and unlike cryptographic techniques, does not degrade prediction latency. Using the training data, labels, a pre-trained model and a privacy-utility knob, they (1) find the pertinent features through perturbation training, and (2) learn utility-preserving constant values for suppressing the non-pertinent data.</description></item><item><title>The Future of Corporate Governance Part I: The Problem of Twelve</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/2018-10-03-problem-of-12/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/2018-10-03-problem-of-12/</guid><description>The Problem of Twelve: In the near future, roughly 12 individuals will have practical power over majority of US public companies.
