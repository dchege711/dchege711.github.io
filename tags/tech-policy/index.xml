      <description>Myths and Fallacies of &amp;#39;Personally Identifiable Information&amp;#39;.  Narayanan, Arvind; Shmatikov, Vitaly. https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/1743546.1743558  .

      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &amp;ldquo;Life After Hate&amp;rdquo; suggested to them. 
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?</description>

      <description>So You Want to Reform Democracy If there was an idea that could &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; democracy, it would have been thought-up already. If you don&amp;rsquo;t see your idea out there, it’s because it didn’t work the hundreds of other times someone tried it.
