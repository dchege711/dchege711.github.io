      <description>Signal Is Finally Bringing Its Secure Messaging To the Masses.  Andy Greenberg. https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/  . https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/02/14/2216214/signal-is-finally-bringing-its-secure-messaging-to-the-masses#comments  . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22326731  . Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&amp;rsquo;d think that at Signal&amp;rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon.</description>

Jun 1, 2010.   What is PII? From Breach Notification Laws: For example, California Senate Bill 1386: SSNs, driver’s license numbers, financial accounts.
The list can never be exhaustive, e.g. email addresses and telephone numbers are not mentioned in Bill 1386.

      <description>One can use curl -v &amp;lt;url&amp;gt; to see all of the redirections and cookies set.  found that generating a tiny URL for Zoom links gives a URL that first goes to redirect.viglink.com.
I tried this on https://tinyurl.com/yyte6pqv, which points to https://www.c13u.com/socioeconomics/2020-11-21-experiments-in-social-economics/, but didn&amp;rsquo;t observe any 3rd party cookies. tinyurl.com did set a cookie, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably expected.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Apps&amp;rdquo; in this context means contact tracing apps released by public health authorities to do contact tracing. The APIs are limited to them.
  Big Picture  Release APIs to enable apps to interoperate between Android and iOS devices.  Bluetooth-based contact tracing baked into Android and iOS, such that no app is needed for broadcasting/listening.  This ensures broad adoption, but will be on an opt-in basis.   Interesting debate for privacy, ethics and public health.</description>

Claim: FB will track relationships and social groups and make that information accessible to law enforcement. FB is a corporation that needs to make money; surveillance makes them money.

      <description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. 
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting  74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description>

China has 750m people; 80% of its internet access is on Android. There&amp;rsquo;s $$$ to be made.
Between 2006 and 2010, Google had maintained a censored Google Search, but was heavily criticized.
Google Search was then uncensored because of &amp;ldquo;Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites and hack Google computer systems&amp;rdquo;</description>
