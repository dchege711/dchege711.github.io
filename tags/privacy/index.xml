      <description>Signal Is Finally Bringing Its Secure Messaging To the Masses.  Andy Greenberg. www.wired.com  . it.slashdot.org  . news.ycombinator.com  . Feb 14, 2020.   Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&amp;rsquo;d think that at Signal&amp;rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon.</description>

      <description>Pre-read thoughts.
I think for the general population, the value of privacy is not worth the inconvenience associated with securing it, in the cases where it&amp;rsquo;s not readily availed by Big Tech. For example, one wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go out of their way to not have passwords and 2FA. However, when it comes to matters like online privacy, most folks are willing to allow surveillance in exchange for free services like web search, social media, etc.</description>

      <description>Myths and Fallacies of &amp;#39;Personally Identifiable Information&amp;#39;.  Narayanan, Arvind; Shmatikov, Vitaly. dl.acm.org  . Jun 1, 2010.    What is PII? From Breach Notification Laws: For example, California Senate Bill 1386: SSNs, driver’s license numbers, financial accounts.
The list can never be exhaustive, e.g. email addresses and telephone numbers are not mentioned in Bill 1386.

      <description>Meta 
Instead of changing the data or learners in multiple ways and then see if fairness improves,  postulate that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that generated the training data. These affect (a) what data was selected, and (b) the labels assigned to the examples. They propose the \(\text{Fair-SMOTE}\) (Fair Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique) algorithm which (1) removes biased labels (via situation testing: if the model&amp;rsquo;s prediction for a data point changes once all of the data points&#39; protected attributes  are flipped, then that label is biased and the data point is discarded), and (2) rebalances internal distributions such that based on a protected attribute, examples are equal in both positive and negative classes.</description>

  Big Picture Release APIs to enable apps to interoperate between Android and iOS devices. Bluetooth-based contact tracing baked into Android and iOS, such that no app is needed for broadcasting/listening.  This ensures broad adoption, but will be on an opt-in basis.</description>

      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &amp;ldquo;Life After Hate&amp;rdquo; suggested to them. 
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?</description>

      <description>Facebook to Pay $550 Million to Settle Facial Recognition Suit.  Natasha Singer; Mike Isaac. The New York Times. www.nytimes.com  . Jan 29, 2020.   Illinois&#39; biometric privacy law requires companies to obtain written permission before collecting a person’s biometrics. Residents have the right to sue for up to $5,000 per violation.
Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Tag Suggestions harvested facial data without getting written consent nor telling Illinois users for how long the data would be kept.</description>

      <description>Targeting Ads Based on Mood NYT&amp;rsquo;s nytDEMO launched perspective targeting, an ad product that allows advertisers to place ads based on the sentiment that the content is predicted to evoke . ESPN, USA Today, and Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Grapeshot have similar products too. 
How successful is this approach? Google, the largest online advertiser, does not mention it in their ads targeting help page   , but Google is not in the publishing business either.</description>

      <description>Facebook Monetizing Encrypted Messaging by Analyzing Metadata.  @SarahJamieLewis. twitter.com  . Jan 25, 2019.   Claim: FB will track relationships and social groups and make that information accessible to law enforcement. FB is a corporation that needs to make money; surveillance makes them money.
Contention: Actual privacy and security must protect metadata as well as content.
 Cwtch by OpenPrivacy   aims to minimize metadata exposed by apps used.</description>

      <description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. 
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting  74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description>
