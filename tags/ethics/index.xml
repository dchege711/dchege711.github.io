Moderators in Phoenix will make just $28,800 per year â€” while the average FB employee has a total compensation of $240,000.
Team leaders micro-manage content moderators&#39; every bathroom break. Two Muslim employees were ordered to stop praying during their 9min/day of allotted &amp;ldquo;wellness time&amp;rdquo;.
