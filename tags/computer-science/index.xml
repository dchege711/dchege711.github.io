      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/ . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674 . Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&amp;rsquo;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>Mergeable Replicated Data Types [] On a distributed system, each replica should [eventually] converge to the same state. Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) can accept updates and achieve consistent without remote synchronization.
The Need for Commutativity Say we have a queue \( 1 \to 2 \). Suppose two replicas, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), independently call pop(). Each replica will have \(2\) on their queue.
However, on receiving an update that the other replica popped, each replica will call pop() to be consistent, thereby deleting \(2\).</description>

      <description>OCR tends to miss (sometimes) really important context.
Make use of derived data, e.g. age at marriage, gender differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names
Don&amp;rsquo;t spend all your time cleaning data.
Try a sequence of things, not one big idea.
Don&amp;rsquo;t expect existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not as straightforward.

      <title>How the Enlightenment Ends [Henry Kissinger]</title>

      <description>Horsemen of the End of Enlightenment Kissinger&amp;rsquo;s waking call was the triumph of AlphaGo. He is wary of the self-learning machine.
The printing press sparked the Age of Reason. However, a world reliant on data &amp;amp; algorithms, uncontrollable by ethical/philosophical norms will upend the Age of Reason. The people developing AI care more about technical feats than ethical/philosophical issues.
Harbingers of the end of enlightenment: information overload diverts people from introspection, ability to target micro-groups breaks up the previous consensus on priorities.</description>
