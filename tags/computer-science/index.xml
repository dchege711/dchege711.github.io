      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674. Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&#39;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>OCR tends to miss (sometimes) really important context.
Make use of derived data, e.g. age at marriage, gender differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names
Don&#39;t spend all your time cleaning data.
Try a sequence of things, not one big idea.
Don&#39;t expect existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not as straightforward.

      <description>Horsemen of the End of Enlightenment Kissinger&#39;s waking call was the triumph of AlphaGo. He is wary of the self-learning machine.
The printing press sparked the Age of Reason. However, a world reliant on data &amp;amp; algorithms, uncontrollable by ethical/philosophical norms will upend the Age of Reason. The people developing AI care more about technical feats than ethical/philosophical issues.
Harbingers of the end of enlightenment: information overload diverts people from introspection, ability to target micro-groups breaks up the previous consensus on priorities.</description>
