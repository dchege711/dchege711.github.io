      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. []

When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>

You had a great idea. You discovered a beautiful beach to lay on, but other people didn&amp;rsquo;t just follow you and lay down themselves; they built condos and restaurants while you were watching the sunset. Soon your great idea loses its appeal.
But you put so much work into the great idea that it&amp;rsquo;s become an inseparable part of your identity.</description>
