      <description>Startups vs. Incumbents  Why Do Competitive Edges Die?
 Having a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking.

      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read.

When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>
