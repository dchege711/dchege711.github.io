      <description>Choose your content. Some material not worth the effort. Learning comes from repetition, but sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read.

Grounded Theory: pose question; collect data; iteratively review that data while encoding ideas/concepts that &amp;ldquo;emerge&amp;rdquo; from the data.</description>
