A lot changed since mid-2021, when I initially wrote this page. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT took the world by storm &amp;ndash; reaching 123m MAU less than 3 months after launch and becoming the fastest-growing consumer application in history (TikTok took 9 months to hit 100m MAU).</description></item><item><title>On DNA Testing</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/health-and-medicine/2018-09-18-on-dna-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/health-and-medicine/2018-09-18-on-dna-testing/</guid><description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene.
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting 74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description></item></channel></rss>
