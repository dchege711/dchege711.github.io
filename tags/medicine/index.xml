      <description>There are two types of failure: ignorance (misunderstanding of how the world works) and ineptitude (failing to apply our knowledge correctly). Advancements in science have tilted failures towards ineptitude.
For example, heart attack patients who would benefit from cardiac balloon therapy should have it administered within 90 minutes of arrival. In 2006, an average hospital had less than 50% chance of achieving testing, informing patient and obtaining consent, confirming allergies, readying a cath team and starting the therapy within 90 min.</description>

  Norms for Scientific Activity and the Sources of Error &amp;ldquo;Science&amp;rdquo; is taken to mean &amp;ldquo;Natural Science&amp;rdquo;.
  Internal norms derive from a cognitive pursuit of science. They are:
 Focus on the central rather than the peripheral problems of the science in in question.</description>
