      <description>Bloated Dependencies A bloated dependency is one which is packaged in the application binary, but is not needed to run the application.
There are two levels to this: (1) a source file declares a dependency on foo but never actually uses foo, and (2) the application as a whole never uses foo. An optimal de-bloating solution would first address (1) and then tackle (2).
Some languages may have better tooling than others when it comes to automatically de-bloating their dependencies.</description>

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94%  Google Directions API limited their free tier   . CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>
