      <description>Identifying Vulnerabilities No matter the obfuscation in the source code, the malicious package will have to make system calls in order to do anything interesting. These system calls are easier to analyze. 
Suggestions Know your dependencies by heart. Know the maintainers. Be aware of problems going on in the project and help, e.g. patches, funding sources, etc.

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94%  Google Directions API limited their free tier   . CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>
