      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&#39;t care whether you&#39;ll remember what you&#39;ve read. []
But even if you don&#39;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>

      <description>You need to develop a broad spectrum of style and then be able to move from one end of the spectrum to the other as occasion demands. You&#39;ll develop a basic style but inability to diversify is being like a baller with a drive but no jump shot. Questions to ask: What am I writing about? Who will read what I&#39;ve written? Why did I write it?   I&#39;m writing about topics that I want to know more about.</description>
