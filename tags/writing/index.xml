      <description>The Age of the Essay.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html. Sep 1, 2004.  The purpose of an essay is to figure something out. Ergo, you can&#39;t begin with a statement.
Expressing ideas helps you form them. Writing something that others might read forces you to think well.
Writing also helps me code better. When I have a nasty bug, it&#39;s easy to try out so many ideas such that you lose track of what you&#39;ve learned.</description>

      <description>You need to develop a broad spectrum of style and then be able to move from one end of the spectrum to the other as occasion demands. You&#39;ll develop a basic style but inability to diversify is being like a baller with a drive but no jump shot. Questions to ask: What am I writing about? Who will read what I&#39;ve written? Why did I write it?   I&#39;m writing about topics that I want to know more about.</description>
