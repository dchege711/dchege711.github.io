Building Transit Networks Can a cell learn? When a part of the plasmodium touches something attractive, e.g. food, it pulses more quickly and widens. If a part meets something repulsive, like light, it pulses more slowly and shrinks.
The article regards this as flowing in the best possible direction without conscious thought.

Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. https://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf. 2016-02-17.  The First Pass (5 - 10 min) Objectives: category, context, validity of assumptions, contributions and quality of writing.
 Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else Glance at the math to determine the underlying theoretical foundations Read the conclusions. Mentally tick off references that you&#39;ve already read.</description>

      <title>How to Read and Know [Paul Graham, Robert Heaton]</title>

      <description>How to Read. Robert Heaton. https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17424652. 2018-06-25.   Know. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html. 2014-12-01.  Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort.
Information overload is one of my major obstacles to reading to know. There are so many pieces out there. I&#39;m biased towards highly upvoted HN submissions. My RSS feeds ran out of control a while back - my queue has +400 pending articles :-/</description>

      <title>The Age of the Essay [Paul Graham]</title>

      <description>The Age of the Essay. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html. 2004-09-01.  The purpose of an essay is to figure something out. Ergo, you can&#39;t begin with a statement.
Expressing ideas helps you form them. Writing something that others might read forces you to think well.
Writing also helps me code better. When I have a nasty bug, it&#39;s easy to try out so many ideas such that you lose track of what you&#39;ve learned.</description>
