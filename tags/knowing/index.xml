      <title>Theory About Theories</title>

      <description>On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&#39;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read.</description>

      <description>Immeasurably Important.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/. Jul 5, 2018.  Filtering out information is an art, not a science, necessitated by the information overload that we live in.
 Watch out for the tendency to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world should be. If you think the world is all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about intuitively.  If you think the world is all data, you&#39;ll miss how much is too complicated to summarize in a statistic.</description>

Dec 21, 2016.  Building Transit Networks Can a cell learn? When a part of the plasmodium touches something attractive, e.g. food, it pulses more quickly and widens. If a part meets something repulsive, like light, it pulses more slowly and shrinks.
The article regards this as flowing in the best possible direction without conscious thought.

      <description>What is Ergodicity?  Lars P. Syll. https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/what-is-ergodicity-2/. Nov 23, 2016.  A random process is ergodic if all of its statistics can be determined from a sample function of the process. That is, the ensemble averages equal the corresponding time averages with probability one.
Role of Ergodicity in Human Inference  A newspaper has previously printed some inaccurate information, therefore, the newspaper is going to publish inaccurate information in the future.</description>

Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html. Dec 1, 2014.  Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort.
Information overload is one of my major obstacles to reading to know. There are so many pieces out there. I&#39;m biased towards highly upvoted HN submissions. My RSS feeds ran out of control a while back - my queue has +400 pending articles :-/</description>

      <description>The Age of the Essay.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html. Sep 1, 2004.  The purpose of an essay is to figure something out. Ergo, you can&#39;t begin with a statement.
Expressing ideas helps you form them. Writing something that others might read forces you to think well.
Writing also helps me code better. When I have a nasty bug, it&#39;s easy to try out so many ideas such that you lose track of what you&#39;ve learned.</description>
