      <title>Caveats on Similarity Learning</title>

      <description>Similarity-based learning is intuitive and gives people confidence in the model.
There is an inductive bias that instances that have similar descriptive features belong to the same class.
Remarkably so. When I think of classifying things, my mind immediately goes to NN.
  Similarity learning has a stationary assumption, i.e. the joint PDF of the data doesn&amp;rsquo;t change (new classifications do not come up). This assumption is shared by supervised ML.</description>

      <title>Reading and Writing to Know</title>
      <link>https://www.c13u.com/knowing/2020-05-02-reading-and-writing-to-know/</link>

      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. []
But even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>

      <title>Theory About Theories</title>
      <link>https://www.c13u.com/knowing/2020-01-08-theory-about-theories/</link>

      <description>On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&amp;rsquo;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read.</description>

      <description>Immeasurably Important.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/ . Jul 5, 2018.  Filtering out information is an art, not a science, necessitated by the information overload that we live in.
 Watch out for the tendency to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world should be. If you think the world is all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about intuitively.</description>

 Scan resources and pick the ones that seem most useful (5 hours) Set up the environment and define structured goals (3 hours) Work towards increasingly difficult goals set in step 2 (22 hours)  Each session should be about 4 hours. It takes about 20min to get into the flow.</description>

      <description>Brainless Slime That Can Learn by Fusing.  The Atlantic. https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/12/the-brainless-slime-that-can-learn-by-fusing/511295/ . https://old.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/b245af/til_scientists_put_slime_mold_over_a_map_of_tokyo/ . Dec 21, 2016.  Building Transit Networks Can a cell learn? When a part of the plasmodium touches something attractive, e.g. food, it pulses more quickly and widens. If a part meets something repulsive, like light, it pulses more slowly and shrinks.
The article regards this as flowing in the best possible direction without conscious thought.</description>

      <title>[Summary] (Syll) What is Ergodicity?</title>

      <description>What is Ergodicity?  Lars P. Syll. https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/what-is-ergodicity-2/ . Nov 23, 2016.  A random process is ergodic if all of its statistics can be determined from a sample function of the process. That is, the ensemble averages equal the corresponding time averages with probability one.
Role of Ergodicity in Human Inference  A newspaper has previously printed some inaccurate information, therefore, the newspaper is going to publish inaccurate information in the future.</description>
