      <description>&amp;ldquo;Apps&amp;rdquo; in this context means contact tracing apps released by public health authorities to do contact tracing. The APIs are limited to them.
  Big Picture  Release APIs to enable apps to interoperate between Android and iOS devices. [] Bluetooth-based contact tracing baked into Android and iOS, such that no app is needed for broadcasting/listening. [] This ensures broad adoption, but will be on an opt-in basis. []  Interesting debate for privacy, ethics and public health.</description>

      <description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. []
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting [] 74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description>
