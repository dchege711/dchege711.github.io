      <description>The lack of explanability is a common theme. Higher-ups claim the machine is unbiased, while the workers on the ground say, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not me; it&amp;rsquo;s the computer&amp;rdquo;.
 Automating Inequality: How High-tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor   should be an enlightening read.

      <description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. 
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting  74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description>
