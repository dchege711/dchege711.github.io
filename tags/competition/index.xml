      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94% [] Google Directions API limited their free tier. CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&#39;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>

      <description>Counterintuitive Competitive Advantages.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/counterintuitive-competitive-advantages/. Mar 13, 2019.  Growing big antlers requires lots of Ca and Ph, which are rare. Small antlers were required to survive low-food winters, but big antlers were required to impress females to mate. The Irish elk spiraled to extinction.
I get the analogy that Housel is trying to paint, but this seems like an oversimplification. Sure, big antlers are sexy, but if small antlers are all that&#39;s left on the menu, I doubt female antlers will think &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>AT&amp;amp;T restricted FaceTime from running on some data plans. Justifications?
 FaceTime is preloaded, therefore 100% of users have it FaceTime wasn&#39;t efficient in network usage. The capacity was asymmetrical, but video chat is symmetrical  Interestingly enough, AT&amp;amp;T required Apple to greenlight it, which they did. AT&amp;amp;T worked with top developers to teach network etiquette.</description>

      <description>The Trajectory of Great Ideas.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ideas/. Aug 14, 2018.  Sears. Blockbuster. Nokia. AOL. You had a great idea. You discovered a beautiful beach to lay on, but other people didn&#39;t just follow you and lay down themselves; they built condos and restaurants while you were watching the sunset. Soon your great idea loses its appeal.
But you put so much work into the great idea that it&#39;s become an inseparable part of your identity.</description>

      <description>Why Competitive Edges Die.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/why-competitive-advantages-die/. Feb 8, 2018.  The Beginner&#39;s Mind Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.
Knowing you have a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your chosen strategy.
The Burden of Being Profitable Nothing to lose is a wonderful thing to have.</description>

      <description>Betting on Things That Never Change.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/. Jul 20, 2017.  Change by itself is hard. Investors have to spot it before it&#39;s obvious. Consumers have to change their behaviors to make it viable. These two points repel each other.
Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>
