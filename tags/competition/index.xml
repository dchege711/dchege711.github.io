      <description>Startups vs. Incumbents  Why Do Competitive Edges Die?
 Having a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking. []

      <description>The Food Delivery Mafia Google allows certain booking and ordering services from third-party providers (e.g. Doordash) to automatically appear with business listings. To edit such links, the business has to contact the third party. Complaints by restaurants: Doordash has poor service that reflects on the restaurant; sometimes owners have their own delivery service which is circumvented; Doordash charges the restaurant for orders made through them. []
It&amp;rsquo;s more likely that Doordash and Grubhub will have more technical expertise to navigate online listings - they have deep money-losing, but user-growth-fueling pockets (e.</description>

      <description>Protectionism vs. Globalization Prestige Ameritech is America&amp;rsquo;s #1 maker of surgical masks. In outbreaks, demand peaks, but when it&amp;rsquo;s all over, hospitals go back to exclusively buying cheaper masks from China. Reduced demand makes Ameritech lay off workers. Ameritech is pushing for a federal contract to stabilize demand over time. []
India&amp;rsquo;s Foreign Exchange Act of 1973 gave Coca-Cola an ultimatum: hand over 60% of the local subsidiary to Indian partners and the syrup recipe.</description>

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94% [] Google Directions API limited their free tier  . CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>

      <description>AT&amp;amp;T restricted FaceTime from running on some data plans. Justifications?
 FaceTime is preloaded, therefore 100% of users have it FaceTime wasn&amp;rsquo;t efficient in network usage. The capacity was asymmetrical, but video chat is symmetrical  Interestingly enough, AT&amp;amp;T required Apple to greenlight it, which they did. AT&amp;amp;T worked with top developers to teach network etiquette.</description>

      <description>Betting on Things That Never Change.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/ . Jul 20, 2017.  Change by itself is hard. Investors have to spot it before it&amp;rsquo;s obvious. Consumers have to change their behaviors to make it viable. These two points repel each other.
Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>
