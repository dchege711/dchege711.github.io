      <description>Kobayashi Maru.  Epsilon Theory. https://www.epsilontheory.com/kobayashi-maru/. Jan 29, 2019.  Environmental, Social and Governance Investing. So general as to be meaningless: marketing BS (thinking &amp;lsquo;holistically&amp;rsquo; about ESG risk factors as part of the investment process) to impact investing (providing wholesale financing for community lending initiatives).
ESG! The meme is about selling portfolios as virtue signaling devices. It moves the conversation away from fees and performance to values. Don&#39;t you want to make a difference?</description>

      <description>Betting on Things That Never Change.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/. Jul 20, 2017.  Change by itself is hard. Investors have to spot it before it&#39;s obvious. Consumers have to change their behaviors to make it viable. These two points repel each other.
Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>
