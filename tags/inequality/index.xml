      <description>Quiz It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give pessimistic answers when the book&amp;rsquo;s title says &amp;ldquo;Things Are Better Than You Think&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
    In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?
üî≤‚ÄÖA: 20 percent
‚ùå‚ÄÖB: 40 percent
‚úÖ‚ÄÖC: 60 percent
There has been lots of efforts to get girls to finish primary school, e.g. providing sanitary towels. Surely, they must be at \( \ge 40% \) completion rates.</description>

      <description>The paper is written in a period when NLP practitioners are producing bigger (# of parameters; size of training data) language models (LMs), and pushing the top scores on benchmarks.
  Environmental Risks Large LMs consume a lot of resources, e.g. training a single BERT base model on GPUs was estimated to use as much energy as a trans-American flight.
Marginalized communities are doubly punished. They are least likely to benefit from LMs, e.</description>

      <description>Third Base  Not recognizing your blessings feeds into the dark side of capitalism and meritocracy: success is a choice, and that those who haven‚Äôt achieved success are not unlucky, but unworthy.
I&amp;rsquo;m relatively lucky. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much of the techie hubris that I bear. I have unresolved feelings about meritocracy and fairness. Race is usually used as a proxy for bridging the gap, e.g. affirmative action at colleges.</description>
