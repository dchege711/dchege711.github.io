Batman: White Knight. Sean Murphy. www.dc.com . www.hoopladigital.com . 2017. First time encountering a comic where the same person wrote, pencilled and inked the work. The panels should be truer to what the writer intended.
Snapshots [Joker] Admit it &amp;ndash; I gave you Gotham City! This corrupt war zone is the home we created together.</description></item><item><title>Batman Vol. 1: Their Dark Designs</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/batman-2016-their-dark-designs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/batman-2016-their-dark-designs/</guid><description>Batman: Vol. 1: Their Dark Designs.

Batman: Vol. 1: Their Dark Designs. James Tynion IV; Guillem March; Tomeu Morey. www.dc.com . www.hoopladigital.com . Tynion IV&amp;rsquo;s Department of Truth is entertaining in its treatment of truth. Coming in with a bit of bias for Tynion IV&amp;rsquo;s writing.
Snapshots [Batman] It happened in the little moments. I&amp;rsquo;d sketch on the edge of a napkin, or at the corner of a page in an old casebook.</description></item><item><title>The Mighty</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/tomasi-mighty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/tomasi-mighty/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The Mighty&amp;rdquo;.

Snapshots [Mrs. Sharpe] Goliath knew what he was doing. He was breaking a law designed to save people&amp;rsquo;s lives. If he&amp;rsquo;d only gone legitimate. He&amp;rsquo;d still be alive.
