      <description>The Trajectory of Great Ideas. Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ideas/. 2018-08-14.  Sears. Blockbuster. Nokia. AOL. You had a great idea. You discovered a beautiful beach to lay on, but other people didn&#39;t just follow you and lay down themselves; they built condos and restaurants while you were watching the sunset.

      <description>Why I Love B2B over B2C. Justin Kan. Atrium. https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/. 2018-07-11.  B2B customers will actually pay for your product. You have a clear execution path - they&#39;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&#39;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>
