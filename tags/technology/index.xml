      <description>The lack of explanability is a common theme. Higher-ups claim the machine is unbiased, while the workers on the ground say, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not me; it&amp;rsquo;s the computer&amp;rdquo;.
 Automating Inequality: How High-tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor   should be an enlightening read.

      <description>The paper is written in a period when NLP practitioners are producing bigger (# of parameters; size of training data) language models (LMs), and pushing the top scores on benchmarks.
  Environmental Risks Large LMs consume a lot of resources, e.g. training a single BERT base model on GPUs was estimated to use as much energy as a trans-American flight.
Marginalized communities are doubly punished. They are least likely to benefit from LMs, e.</description>
