      <description>20 years later, JetBrains is valued at $7b without taking VC money. HN users praise JetBrains for being user-focused, and the prevailing argument is that VC money comes with growth-hacking attached. 
Is the Lean Startup Dead? Katzenberg (Paramount, Disney Studios &amp;amp; DreamWorks) has raised $1.75b for NewTV, a startup banking on consumers wanting a subscription for 10-minute programs on mobile.
They renamed to quibi.com/   . At least that makes them more searchable on Google.</description>

      <description>Consultants are not well suited for strategy (you probably have a deeper understanding). They are also an expensive way of proving your point to management. However, they are good for emergency horsepower, e.g. data analysis, and for primary research within your industry (they probably have a broader understanding). 
Having a competitive advantage may reduce the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking.</description>

      <description>How to Get Startup Ideas  Err on the side of having competitors, but make sure that you have a thesis that everyone else is overlooking, e.g. Google wasn&amp;rsquo;t averse to users leaving google.com ASAP.
The Startup Idea Matrix, ( B2B Edition   , B2C Edition   ) is a good start for knowing who to google.
  Big companies tend to be slow at changing their approach.</description>

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94%  Google Directions API limited their free tier   . CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>

      <description>Short Term Loans A common narrative for loan providers is financial inclusion. 69% of global adult population is not covered by credit bureaus. Using non-traditional data (e.g. text messages, location, contacts, call logs), more people can get scored. 
If only \(x\%\) of people pay you back, then \(\frac{x}{100}(1 + r) \ge 1 \) suggests \(r \ge \frac{100}{x} - 1 \). If \(75\%\) tend to pay back, \(r = 33\frac{1}{3} \%\).</description>

      <description>Is Dentistry a Science?  Ferris Jabr. www.theatlantic.com  . May 1, 2019.    Cochrane Oral Health   reviews dental procedures in a systematic manner. Unfortunately, most of the reviews don&amp;rsquo;t find substantive support for dental interventions.
There is currently no substantive evidence for: binannual cleanings, fluoridation reducing tooth decay in adults; regular flossing combating plaque (gum disease? probably); preventative wisdom teeth removal; tooth-colored resin instead of metal amalgam fillings; crown vs.</description>

      <description>The Shady Economics of Buy-One-Get-One Free Deals.  Zachary Crockett. thehustle.co  . Feb 17, 2019.   BOGO goods are usually low-demand, non-efficient, lacking in quality and/or close to the expiration date. The BOGO deal is usually a 50% discount off of the manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail price (MSRP). And oftentimes, this price is artificially marked up to begin with.
 MyPillow offered BOGO deal on their pillows, but really just doubled the price of the first pillow.</description>

      <description>[These creators] prove that little daring and discipline can go a long way, and that entrepreneurship is accessible to everyone.
Is it though? Some are born into situations where entrepreneurial risk is unbearable. It&amp;rsquo;s not as meritocratic as the author claims.
  The author arrived at the 6 essential skills via Grounded Theory analysis of interviews with ~200 creators.
Grounded Theory: pose question; collect data; iteratively review that data while encoding ideas/concepts that &amp;ldquo;emerge&amp;rdquo; from the data.</description>

      <description>The Submarine.  Paul Graham. www.paulgraham.com  . Apr 1, 2005.   Many people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come.</description>
