      <description>Counterintuitive Competitive Advantages. Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/counterintuitive-competitive-advantages/. 2019-03-13.  Growing big antlers requires lots of Ca and Ph, which are rare. Small antlers were required to survive low-food winters, but big antlers were required to impress females to mate. The Irish elk spiraled to extinction.
I get the analogy that Housel is trying to paint, but this seems like an oversimplification. Sure, big antlers are sexy, but if small antlers are all that&#39;s left on the menu, I doubt female antlers will think &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Is the Lean Startup Dead?. Steve Blank. https://steveblank.com/2018/09/05/is-the-lean-startup-dead/. 2018-09-05.  Katzenberg (Paramount, Disney Studios &amp;amp; DreamWorks) has raised $1.75b for NewTV, a startup banking on consumers wanting a subscription for 10-minute programs on mobile.
They renamed to quibi.com/. At least that makes them more searchable on Google. &amp;ldquo;NewTV&amp;rdquo; searches lead to newtv.org, a community media center for the residents of Newton, Massachusetts.
  After the rubble of the dotcom crash, startups and investors needed a lean approach to survive long enough to generate revenue and profits.</description>

      <description>The Trajectory of Great Ideas. Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ideas/. 2018-08-14.  Sears. Blockbuster. Nokia. AOL. You had a great idea. You discovered a beautiful beach to lay on, but other people didn&#39;t just follow you and lay down themselves; they built condos and restaurants while you were watching the sunset. Soon your great idea loses its appeal.
But you put so much work into the great idea that it&#39;s become an inseparable part of your identity.</description>

VCs may not be looking for growth potential.</description>

      <description>Why I Love B2B over B2C. Justin Kan. Atrium. https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/. 2018-07-11.  B2B customers will actually pay for your product. You have a clear execution path - they&#39;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&#39;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>

      <description>Why Competitive Edges Die. Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/why-competitive-advantages-die/. 2018-02-08.  The Beginner&#39;s Mind Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.
Knowing you have a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your chosen strategy.
The Burden of Being Profitable Nothing to lose is a wonderful thing to have. Having a quarterly dividend to maintain is what happens after you build something great.</description>

      <description>Do Things That Don&amp;#39;t Scale. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html. 2013-07-01.  Recruit manually. Don&#39;t send links. Set them up on the spot.
Ask how big the startup would be if you did the right things, not whether you&#39;re currently changing the world.
Delight your initial customers. Tim Cook can&#39;t send handwritten notes, but you can.
If you can solve the problem manually, do so while gradually automating the most pressing bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>How to Get Startup Ideas. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html. 2012-11-01.  Err on the side of having competitors, but make sure that you have a thesis that everyone else is overlooking, e.g. Google wasn&#39;t averse to users leaving google.com ASAP
The Startup Idea Matrix, (B2B Edition, B2C Edition) is a good start for knowing who to google.
  In college, take classes in different areas in lieu of taking entrepreneurship classes.</description>
