      <description>Standing Against Hate. https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19503094. 2019-03-27.  Main Article We now ban praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism on FB and Instagram
We didn&#39;t ban them before because their broader concepts, e.g. American pride and Basque separatism, are an important part of people&#39;s identity.
Experts in race relations have confirmed that white nationalism and separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups.</description>

Moderators in Phoenix will make just $28,800 per year — while the average FB employee has a total compensation of $240,000.
Team leaders micro-manage content moderators&amp;rsquo; every bathroom break. Two Muslim employees were ordered to stop praying during their 9min/day of allotted &amp;ldquo;wellness time&amp;rdquo;.
Employees can be fired after making just a handful of errors a week, and those who remain live in fear of former colleagues returning to seek vengeance.</description>

      <description>Facebook Monetizing Encrypted Messaging by Analyzing Metadata. @SarahJamieLewis. https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1088914192847917056. 2019-01-25.  Claim: FB will track relationships and social groups and make that information accessible to law enforcement. FB is a corporation that needs to make money; surveillance makes them money.
Contention: Actual privacy and security must protect metadata as well as content.
Cwtch by OpenPrivacy aims to minimize metadata exposed by apps used. It&#39;s built on Tor. Challenges: message latency, server reliability &amp;amp; discovery, (online) first contact problem for key exchange.</description>
