      <description>Stories of Your Life and Others.  Ted Chiang. 2010. ISBN: 9781931520898 .   Tower of Babylon Story focused on Hillalum, who lived during the construction of the Tower of Babel .
 notes that the Hebrew school version was more elaborate than the Old Testament account, e.g. the tower is so tall that it takes a year to climb, and when a man falls to his death, no one mourns, but when a brick is dropped, the brick-layers weep because it will take a year to replace.</description>
