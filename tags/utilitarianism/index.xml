      <description>Crime Drama Ozark&amp;rsquo;s highlights are Ruth Langmore&amp;rsquo;s 90s&#39; hip hop playlist, Wendy Byrde&amp;rsquo;s sociopathic ambition, and Del Rio&amp;rsquo;s suave. The show follows the Byrde family that has to launder money for the Navarro Cartel. The writers use shortcuts as the show proceeds, and grant excessive plot armor for the Byrde family in subsequent seasons.
