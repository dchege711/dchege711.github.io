Katzenberg (Paramount, Disney Studios &amp;amp; DreamWorks) has raised $1.75b for NewTV, a startup banking on consumers wanting a subscription for 10-minute programs on mobile.
They renamed to quibi.com/. At least that makes them more searchable on Google. &amp;ldquo;NewTV&amp;rdquo; searches lead to newtv.org, a community media center for the residents of Newton, Massachusetts.
  After the rubble of the dotcom crash, startups and investors needed a lean approach to survive long enough to generate revenue and profits.</description>

      <description>Why I Love B2B over B2C. Justin Kan. Atrium. https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/. 2018-07-11.  B2B customers will actually pay for your product. You have a clear execution path - they&#39;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&#39;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>

      <description>Do Things That Don&amp;#39;t Scale. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html. 2013-07-01.  Recruit manually. Don&#39;t send links. Set them up on the spot.
Ask how big the startup would be if you did the right things, not whether you&#39;re currently changing the world.
Delight your initial customers. Tim Cook can&#39;t send handwritten notes, but you can.
If you can solve the problem manually, do so while gradually automating the most pressing bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>How to Get Startup Ideas. Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html. 2012-11-01.  Err on the side of having competitors, but make sure that you have a thesis that everyone else is overlooking, e.g. Google wasn&#39;t averse to users leaving google.com ASAP
The Startup Idea Matrix, (B2B Edition, B2C Edition) is a good start for knowing who to google.
  In college, take classes in different areas in lieu of taking entrepreneurship classes.</description>
