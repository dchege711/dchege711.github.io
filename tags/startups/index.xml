      <description>How to Get Startup Ideas [] Err on the side of having competitors, but make sure that you have a thesis that everyone else is overlooking, e.g. Google wasn&amp;rsquo;t averse to users leaving google.com ASAP.
The Startup Idea Matrix, ( B2B Edition  , B2C Edition  ) is a good start for knowing who to google.
  Big companies tend to be slow at changing their approach. You&amp;rsquo;d think that Yahoo!</description>

      <description>The Food Delivery Mafia Google allows certain booking and ordering services from third-party providers (e.g. Doordash) to automatically appear with business listings. To edit such links, the business has to contact the third party. Complaints by restaurants: Doordash has poor service that reflects on the restaurant; sometimes owners have their own delivery service which is circumvented; Doordash charges the restaurant for orders made through them. []
It&amp;rsquo;s more likely that Doordash and Grubhub will have more technical expertise to navigate online listings - they have deep money-losing, but user-growth-fueling pockets (e.</description>

      <title>Counterintuitive Competitive Advantages [Morgan Housel]</title>

      <description>Counterintuitive Competitive Advantages.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/counterintuitive-competitive-advantages/ . Mar 13, 2019.  Growing big antlers requires lots of Ca and Ph, which are rare. Small antlers were required to survive low-food winters, but big antlers were required to impress females to mate. The Irish elk spiraled to extinction.
I get the analogy that Housel is trying to paint, but this seems like an oversimplification. Sure, big antlers are sexy, but if small antlers are all that&amp;rsquo;s left on the menu, I doubt female antlers will think &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Katzenberg (Paramount, Disney Studios &amp;amp; DreamWorks) has raised $1.75b for NewTV, a startup banking on consumers wanting a subscription for 10-minute programs on mobile.
They renamed to quibi.com/  . At least that makes them more searchable on Google. &amp;ldquo;NewTV&amp;rdquo; searches lead to newtv.org  , a community media center for the residents of Newton, Massachusetts.</description>

      <description>The Trajectory of Great Ideas.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ideas/ . Aug 14, 2018.  Sears. Blockbuster. Nokia. AOL. You had a great idea. You discovered a beautiful beach to lay on, but other people didn&amp;rsquo;t just follow you and lay down themselves; they built condos and restaurants while you were watching the sunset. Soon your great idea loses its appeal.
But you put so much work into the great idea that it&amp;rsquo;s become an inseparable part of your identity.</description>

      <description>Why I Love B2B over B2C.  Justin Kan. Atrium. https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/ . Jul 11, 2018.  B2B customers will actually pay for your product. You have a clear execution path - they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&amp;rsquo;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>

      <description>Do Things That Don&amp;#39;t Scale.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html . Jul 1, 2013.  Recruit manually. Don&amp;rsquo;t send links. Set them up on the spot.
Ask how big the startup would be if you did the right things, not whether you&amp;rsquo;re currently changing the world.
Delight your initial customers. Tim Cook can&amp;rsquo;t send handwritten notes, but you can.
If you can solve the problem manually, do so while gradually automating the most pressing bottlenecks.</description>
