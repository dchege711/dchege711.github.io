      <description>Computers Can Solve Your Problem. You May Not Like the Answer. What happened when Boston Public Schools tried for equity with an algorithm. David Scharfenberg.

 Increase the number of high school students starting school after 8am Decrease the number of elementary school students dismissed after 4pm Accommodate the needs of special education students wherever possible Generate transportation savings that could be reinvested in the schools  Officials picked a solution that attempted to balance several goals — student health, cost savings, and parental happiness.</description>
