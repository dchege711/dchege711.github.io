      <description>The Trauma Floor: The Secret Lives of FB Moderators in America. Casey Newton. The Verge. https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona. 2019-02-25.  Moderators in Phoenix will make just $28,800 per year — while the average FB employee has a total compensation of $240,000.
Team leaders micro-manage content moderators&amp;rsquo; every bathroom break. Two Muslim employees were ordered to stop praying during their 9min/day of allotted &amp;ldquo;wellness time&amp;rdquo;.

Claim: FB will track relationships and social groups and make that information accessible to law enforcement. FB is a corporation that needs to make money; surveillance makes them money.
Contention: Actual privacy and security must protect metadata as well as content.
Cwtch by OpenPrivacy aims to minimize metadata exposed by apps used. It&#39;s built on Tor. Challenges: message latency, server reliability &amp;amp; discovery, (online) first contact problem for key exchange.</description>

      <description>Seeing government influence through coordination of sensitive coverage, localization of negative news &amp;amp; crowding out other stories on the front page.

      <description>Local governments face severe constraints. Liaising with big tech for employees on sabbaticals could alleviate this.
State legislators may have unfounded opinions, but they have the sway, so work with them.
Rural-urban differences. Rural folk were more active. Urban folks wrote angry blogs and that was it.</description>

The capacity was asymmetrical, but video chat is symmetrical  Interestingly enough, AT&amp;amp;T required Apple to greenlight it, which they did. AT&amp;amp;T worked with top developers to teach network etiquette.</description>

The Boston Globe. https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/. 2018-09-21.  Teens need their sleep: sleep-deprived teens are at increased risk for poor academic performance, binge drinking, and suicide.
BPS laid out the algorithm’s four guiding principles:
 Increase the number of high school students starting school after 8am Decrease the number of elementary school students dismissed after 4pm Accommodate the needs of special education students wherever possible Generate transportation savings that could be reinvested in the schools  Officials picked a solution that attempted to balance several goals — student health, cost savings, and parental happiness.</description>

      <description>Cambridge Analytica Uncovered: Secret filming reveals election tricks. Channel 4 News. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpbeOCKZFfQ. 2018-03-19.  Pay people to take surveys but through an app. Mine their profile data, and also crawl their friends.
