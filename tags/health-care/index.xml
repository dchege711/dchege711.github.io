      <description>Is Dentistry a Science?  Ferris Jabr. The Atlantic. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/the-trouble-with-dentistry/586039/. May 1, 2019.  Cochrane Oral Health reviews dental procedures in a systematic manner. Unfortunately, most of the reviews don&#39;t find substantive support for dental interventions.

      <description>How Doctors Die.  Zocalo Public Square. https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/ideas/nexus/.  Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &amp;lsquo;do everything&amp;rsquo;, but often they mean &amp;lsquo;do everything that’s reasonable.&amp;rsquo; But they may not know what’s reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish.</description>

      <description>How Dentists Rip Us Off.  William Ecenbarger. Reader&amp;#39;s Digest. https://digitalsmiledesign.com/files/Old-Website-Assets/PDF/How-Dentists-Rip-Us-Off.pdf. Feb 1, 1997.  This piece was brought up in &amp;ldquo;Is Dentistry a Science?&amp;quot; (summary). Looks like this piece has done its rounds in dentist online spaces.
  Ecenbarger pitch: moving into the area; had done gum surgery; had a direct-reimbursement program to cover expenses; interested in good oral health; no desire for cosmetic improvements
Ecenbarger had a control panel that agreed that #30 needed a cap/filling, and #18 was on the fence.</description>
