      <description>The Principle Brandolini&amp;rsquo;s Bullshit Asymmetry Principle: The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it. 
In Essence of Bullshit  , Frankfurt posits that the essence of bullshit is lack of concern for the truth, which may explain why bullshit is easier to produce.
  Jonathan Swift: Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv&amp;rsquo;d, it is too late; the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Need to develop a theoretical understanding of bullshit. An account of what bullshit is and how it differs from what it is not.
This is a common way of defining concepts in relation to others. Also saw it in the definitions of algebra, geometry and analysis as mathematical categories  
  Remarks on Black&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Prevalence of Humbug&amp;rdquo;   Humbug: deceptive misrepresentation, short of lying, especially by pretentious word or deed, of somebody&amp;rsquo;s own thoughts, feelings or attitudes.</description>

      <description>Deeper Into Bullshit Unlike Frankfurt&amp;rsquo;s argument that &amp;ldquo;the lack of concern to the truth&amp;rdquo; is the essence of bullshit , unclarifiability is the essence of bullshit.
The speaker&amp;rsquo;s state of mind is not a necessary condition: a liar may inadvertently speak the truth; an honest person may mistakenly speak falsely; an honest follower may regurgitate bullshit.

      <description>Method of Definition: Prototype Semantics There is a cognitive science view of categorization that says:
 Category members need not necessarily share a single set of distinguishing features, and may exhibit features to greater/lesser degrees Some category members are more typical than others  This reasoning goes against how I mentally picture a category.
  Although lies may have identifiable features such as misrepresentation of belief, intent to deceive, falseness and reprehensible motives, not all features are always present, and not all features are equally prominent in every instance.</description>
