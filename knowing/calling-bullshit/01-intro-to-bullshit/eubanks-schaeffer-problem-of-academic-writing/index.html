For example, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the store&rdquo; implies grocery store, not a guitar shop.</p><h2 id=protypical-bullshit>Protypical Bullshit</h2><p>Is it deceptive to represent oneself as one aspires to be, but not what one currently is?</p><p>There is debate on the rhetoric self and the &lsquo;constructed self&rsquo;. Is there a pre-existing self to which the bullshitter is not true?</p><p><strong>Prototypical bullshit</strong> has to do with a purposeful misrepresentation of self, has the quality of gamesmanship, and - contrary to Frankfurt&rsquo;s argument - is at least potentially a lie.</p><h2 id=academic-bullshit-among-professors>Academic Bullshit Among Professors</h2><p>The definition of prototypical academic bullshit depends on who is making the judgement.</p><p>When non-academics call academic writing bullshit, they usually mean the articles that receive public scorn, e.g. interpretive papers like <em>&ldquo;Bestio-Scatological Politics in &lsquo;Go Dog, Go&rsquo;"</em>.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><blockquote><p>For example, suppose you have observed that children cry when they fall down. You should write: &ldquo;Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or &lsquo;crying,&rsquo; behavior forms.&rdquo; If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will get a large government grant.</p></blockquote><p>From David Barry&rsquo;s &ldquo;On College&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Barry2010></a></span></p></div></div><p>However, this kind of writing is not typical of academic work. Academics worry about good academic writing, especially in the humanities and social sciences, being <em>something</em> like bullshit.</p><p>Professional rewards like tenure, promotions and grants come from academic reputation, which comes from publication. The reward system encourages the academic writer to emphasize/exaggerate the influence of what they&rsquo;ve written. Yet, in the academic community, there is nothing especially deceptive about this construction of ethos.</p><p>Academic writing generally aims to refute, qualify, or expand positions taken in other academic publications. However, even when the author vehemently disagrees, the opponents' professional reputation must be respected. The writer&rsquo;s tone is that of a dispassionate expert trying to expand a fund of knowledge despite the writer&rsquo;s actual disposition. However, academics do not considered this as prototypical bullshit.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Eubanks2008>A Kind Word for Bullshit: The Problem of Academic Writing<i>.</i></cite>
