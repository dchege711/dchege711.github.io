<p>The media is not all to blame for our overdramatic worldview.</p>
<h2 id="our-dramatic-instincts-and-the-overdramatic-worldview">Our Dramatic Instincts and the Overdramatic Worldview</h2>
<p>The overdramatic worldview: <em>war; violence; natural disasters; corruption; rich get riche and poor get poorer; number of poor people is ever increasing; we&rsquo;ll soon run out of resources.</em></p>
<p>The fact-based worldview: <em>most people are somewhat &lsquo;middle-income&rsquo;; their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated; two-child families; want to go abroad on holiday</em></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re evolutionarily hard wired with instincts that enable swift conclusions. But we must control our appetite for drama lest we subscribe to the overdramatic worldview.</p>
