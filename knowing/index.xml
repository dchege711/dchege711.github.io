The 3-voice Canon Per Tonos from Musikalisches Opfer BWV 1079 exhibits a strange loop. Successive modulations make one expect to hopelessly far from the starting key, but after six modulations, the original key of C minor is restored!
I can&amp;rsquo;t quite perceive the rising canon.</description></item><item><title>In Defense of a Liberal Education</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/in-defense-of-a-liberal-education/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/in-defense-of-a-liberal-education/</guid><description>#education
Societal Preference for STEM Over the Liberal Arts Not everyone can [wants to?] take the sciences, but they were pushed out of their passions into applicable degrees like Business and Communications.
The initially high economic return to applied STEM degrees declines by more than 50% in the first decade. People who major in LA don&amp;rsquo;t get first jobs that are as lucrative, but they do catch up.</description></item><item><title>Misconstructions and Misconceptions</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/2021-08-02-misconstructions-and-misconceptions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/2021-08-02-misconstructions-and-misconceptions/</guid><description>A collection of instances in which I believed something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t true. A reminder to read not to believe, but to weigh and consider .
The Four Color Theorem does not claim that 4 colors suffice to color a planar map. Instead, 4 colors are sufficient to color any planar graph so that no two vertices connected by an edge are colored with the same color. For any \(n\), there is a map that requires at least \(n\) colors.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Academic Research</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/2021-06-15-on-academic-research/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/2021-06-15-on-academic-research/</guid><description>Going to a talk is difficult for everyone because nobody understands the whole thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s especially difficult for undergraduates because they still expect to.
is a rich resource for understanding scholarly literature. Browse it. Some of the listed items are familiar, e.g. Google Scholar, SCImago, Sci-Hub, but it&amp;rsquo;d be informative to zoom out to the larger picture, e.g. good alternatives to Google Scholar.
Why Even Read Papers?</description></item><item><title>On Learning</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/2020-05-02-on-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/2020-05-02-on-learning/</guid><description>Mental Attitude While Learning Distinguish Mere Facts From Conclusions or Opinions Discriminate between mere statements of facts, necessary conclusions which follow therefrom, and mere opinions which they seem to render reasonable. There&amp;rsquo;s no need to perform an experiment to verify that the atomic weight of oxygen is 16. That the sum of the angles of a plane triangle equals two right angles is not a mere fact, but an inevitable truth.</description></item><item><title>[Summary] (Asimov) The Relativity of Wrong</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/1989-09-01-asimov-relativity-of-wrong/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 1989 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/1989-09-01-asimov-relativity-of-wrong/</guid><description>The Relativity of Wrong. Isaac Asimov. chem.tufts.edu . Sep 1, 1989. John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.
The Flat Earthers Earth&amp;rsquo;s curvature is nearly 0.</description></item></channel></rss>
