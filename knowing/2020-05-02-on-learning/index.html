<h3 id="distinguish-mere-facts-from-conclusions-or-opinions">Distinguish Mere Facts From Conclusions or Opinions</h3>
<p>Discriminate between mere statements of facts, necessary conclusions which
follow therefrom, and mere opinions which they seem to render reasonable.
There&rsquo;s no need to perform an experiment to verify that the atomic weight of
oxygen is 16. That the sum of the angles of a plane triangle equals two right
angles is not a mere fact, but an inevitable truth. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="investigate-the-reason-for-facts">Investigate the Reason For Facts</h3>
<p>Why would the wind in a storm in the northern hemisphere revolve
counterclockwise around the storm&rsquo;s center? Definitions are exempt: there is no
reason why New York is 90 miles from Philadelphia. Sometimes the reasons require
specialized knowledge that the student lacks, e.g. the laws of physics. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="if-theres-no-reason-for-the-facts-seek-to-know-how-they-ascertained">If There&rsquo;s No Reason for the Facts, Seek to Know How They Ascertained</h3>
<p>How do we ascertain that the sun is 92 million miles from the earth? Suppose
3,072 Union soldiers were killed in the Battle of Gettysburg. Why 3,072 is not a
reasonable question. But how did we arrive at 3,072? <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="look-out-for-evidence-of-the-writers-reliability">Look Out for Evidence of the Writer&rsquo;s Reliability</h3>
<p>Faulty conclusions/opinions may result from illogical reasoning from correct
facts, especially when it has to do with statistical results. Be wary of overly
dogmatic opinions and intolerability towards those that hold different
conclusions. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<p>Of late, the phrase &ldquo;do your research&rdquo; has been popular <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#GTrendsDoYourResearch"></a></span>, with some pushing back claiming that lay people tend
to entrench their initial opinions and should not do their own research, but
instead defer to the consensus of scientific experts <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Siegel2020"></a></span>.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>On &ldquo;lay people entrenching their initial opinions&rdquo;, there is also

<h3 id="exercise-caution">Exercise Caution</h3>
<p>Read not to contradict and to confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor
to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>

the Lie of the Day became more subtle, prompting the students to evaluate the
content, and propose candidates for the Lie of the Day.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h3 id="an-open-mind-no-preconceived-ideas">An Open Mind; No Preconceived Ideas</h3>
<p>Clearly formulate a problem, gather all pertinent facts, and then draw the
logical conclusion. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="study-to-gain-wisdom-rather-than-knowledge">Study to Gain Wisdom, Rather Than Knowledge</h3>
<p>Being knowledgeable is being full of other people&rsquo;s thoughts. Instead, strive to
be aware of your own thoughts in relation to your knowledge. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<p>The first thought is always someone else&rsquo;s. Only by concentrating, sticking to
the question, being patient, letting all the parts of your mind come to play do
you arrive at original idea. And often, that idea needs further refinement.
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Deresiewicz2009"></a></span></p>
<p>It also helps to think out loud with a person that you feel safe with. You
discover what you believe in the course of articulating it: doubts you aren&rsquo;t
supposed to have, questions you&rsquo;re not supposed to ask, opinions that&rsquo;d get you
laughed at or reprimanded, and so on. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Deresiewicz2009"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="studying-understandingly">Studying Understandingly</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you dig a hole, hundreds of feet deep. Will the bottom be warmer or
colder than the top?&rdquo; Crickets. The teacher said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they know, but
you&rsquo;re not asking the right question.&rdquo; &ldquo;In what condition is the interior of the
globe?&rdquo; Half the class, <em>&ldquo;In a condition of igneous fusion!&quot;</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<p>Terms like <em>energy</em>, <em>momentum</em>, <em>rate of change</em>, <em>period of vibration</em>,
<em>value</em>, <em>social justice</em>, etc., are often used without a clear understanding.
Vagueness of an idea may impair all reasoning regarding it. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="test-what-you-think-you-already-know">Test What You Think You Already Know</h3>
<p>Try defining a common word and compare the result with what the dictionary says.
For instance, what is a cow? <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Stumped me too. Dictionary: <em>a fully grown female animal of a domesticated breed
of ox, kept to produce milk or beef.</em></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Some central themes, e.g. freedom is a desirable thing, have well thought-out
arguments that we tend to overlook because we agree with the statement. Studying
philosophy, especially by thinkers who disagree, is valuable. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#HN-FSThinking"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="study-logic">Study Logic</h3>
<p>The study of logic would enable you to see just where the error lies. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span> Formal logic helps clarify your thinking, e.g. difference
between validity and truth. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#HN-FSThinking"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="restate-things-in-different-ways-or-points-of-view">Restate Things In Different Ways or Points of View</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as understanding something but being unable to explain
it.But repeating a statement in different words is not proving it, e.g. <em>Why can
one see through glass? Because it is transparent.</em> To understand a conclusion,
you must see the steps in its logical demonstration. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="state-a-thing-not-only-positively-but-also-negatively">State a Thing Not Only Positively But Also Negatively</h3>
<p>For conclusions and opinions, see what objections can be raised and address
them. But for areas like mathematics, seeking objections isn&rsquo;t gainful because
the principles are rigid and not open to question. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="distill-statements-to-fundamentals">Distill Statements to Fundamentals</h3>
<p><em>Matter is that which can occupy space.</em> Would it be proper to say, <em>&ldquo;Matter is
that which occupies space&rdquo;</em>? <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<p><em>The number of independent equations must equal the number of unknown
quantities.</em> What does &ldquo;independent&rdquo; mean? Can it be omitted? Must each equation
contain all the unknown quantities? <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="keep-the-mind-active-and-alert">Keep the Mind Active and Alert</h3>
<p>Dreamy thinking often enables ideas to clarify and take shape and proportion.
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="on-encountering-different-points-of-view-investigate-where-the-divergence-arises">On Encountering Different Points of View, Investigate Where the Divergence Arises</h3>
<p>Failing to grasp all the pertinent facts, or even the problem itself; reasoning
incorrectly even from accurate premises; seeing facts out of proportion. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch2"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="a-system-of-study">A System of Study</h2>
<h3 id="discover-the-fundamental-idea">Discover the Fundamental Idea</h3>
<p>It helps you master the subject because the other details can be viewed in
relation to the fundamental idea. Facts of secondary importance may then be left
for later readings. Fundamental principles should frequently be memorized. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="lay-out-pre-existing-knowledge">Lay Out Pre-Existing Knowledge</h3>
<p>Classify what you already know [and what you don&rsquo;t know]. If you know nothing,
insist on getting a clear idea of the subject, its extent, objects, methods,
applications and relations to other subjects. In doing so, you cultivate an
interest in what you&rsquo;re studying. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="classify-and-arrange-your-learnings">Classify and Arrange Your Learnings</h3>
<p>Stop and think over the ground that has been covered, and arrange the various
points made. Close the book from time to time and go over in your mind what you
have learned. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<p>Make flashcards of facts/quotes that you wish to analyze. Do a write-up in your
own words. Revisit arguments that weren&rsquo;t convincing. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Heaton2018"></a></span></p>
<p>Collect questions and counter-arguments into a &lsquo;questions&rsquo; basket. Answer
questions from this basket in your free time. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Heaton2018"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>The basket should have a hard cap, e.g. 20 questions. Picking a question at
random to investigate is a nice way of staying motivated. It also helps when you
have an hour or so of free time, but not necessarily set on what you want to
read.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions
and unjustified assumptions. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Heaton2018"></a></span></p>
<h3 id="work-independently-of-others">Work Independently of Others</h3>
<p>Seek only suggestions when you need help, except for mere facts, which you
cannot be expected to reason out. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<p>When you make mistakes, discover the causes and remedy them so as to avoid
analogous mistakes. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<p><em>From the above, it is evident&hellip;</em> close the book. Can you state what is
evident? <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes authors may omit necessary logical steps, so don&rsquo;t spend too much time
investigating how <em>they</em> reached a conclusion. Is there an alternate route? <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch3"></a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes you need to put down the material and think about what you&rsquo;re reading:
what <em>you</em> think about what you&rsquo;re reading. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Deresiewicz2009"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>
<p>Knowing how to study is especially important because college can only cover so
much. Furthermore, a student&rsquo;s career requirements may change. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch0"></a></span></p>
<p>Nothing is true simply because it is in a book. It must pass the test of one&rsquo;s
understanding. In case the understanding is beyond the student, they must
perceive whether it&rsquo;s mere fact, definition or opinion. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch0"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Back in 1917, you could probably assume that if it was on a book, then it had a
bit of authority - not everyone could print a book. The modern-day equivalent is
a peer-reviewed paper.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Be intellectually modest. Not understanding what you know and what you don&rsquo;t
know makes you overestimate your knowledge. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch1"></a></span></p>
<p>Pick the best book. New to a subject? Start with the elementary one. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch4"></a></span></p>
<p>Study a few subjects at once, but not too many. The mind needs change of
occupation, not idleness. Weigh carefully before taking up or dropping a study.
Read much but not many books. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch4"></a></span></p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the
world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial
because the material compiles differently. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Graham2014"></a></span></p>
<p>Fix your mind intensely on one thing for a time long enough to develop an idea
about it. Multitasking is correlated with poor performance in tasks like
distnguishing between relevant and irrelevant information, keeping information
in the right contextual box and retrieving it quickly, and switching between
tasks. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Deresiewicz2009"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>AKA &ldquo;Deep Work&rdquo;. The new old thing.</p>
<p>The disservice of multi-tasking is surprising to me. The study cited by <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Deresiewicz2009"></a></span> could have been designed differently, e.g. whether to test
people&rsquo;s cognitive functions be tested while they are multitasking. That said, I
doubt there is evidence for multitasking being good for critical thinking.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Apply what you&rsquo;re studying. Book knowledge is of little value in itself. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch4"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>There&rsquo;s levels to applying what I learn. Say I learn of some concept, e.g.
differential privacy. I can implement a DP-computation in Python and that&rsquo;s
application. But a toy application may not always hold up in the real world. The
second level of application involves deploying it in practice. This may not be
feasible, but the good thing about software is that you can model the real world
scenario to some extent.</p>
<p>Mathematical knowledge is something else though. I&rsquo;ve wanted to learn linear
algebra for the sake of it. It makes me feel good about myself, and I find value
in that.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Set times for recreative study, e.g. cards, chess, billiards. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch4"></a></span></p>
<p>Exercise. A healthy body is necessary for top mental performance. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Swain1917-Ch4"></a></span></p>
<p>Institutions are needed because left to our own, we only cherry-pick what we
want to learn, which may not encompass all that we <em>should</em> learn. Given that
institutions need accountability, they impose metrics, which break how we want
to learn. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Anon2021"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>What if the underlying principle could be distilled, and the learning context
tailored to the students? For example, students with a preference for biology
could learn probability in the context of biological study. That way, they&rsquo;re
learning about what they want (biology) while also picking up necessary topics
(probability).</p>
</div>
</div>





<div class="priors-holder">
    <div class="priors"><p>Thinking deeply is costly, and I can&rsquo;t afford to be doing it all the time.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>You can&rsquo;t make good decisions without good thinking, and good thinking requires
time. The busiest people are often the ones who make the worst decisions, and
thus spend a lot of time correcting poor decisions. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#FSThinking"></a></span></p>
