      <description>The order of learning: the necessary, the useful, the ornamental.
A teacher&amp;rsquo;s duty is to show the student what he can do for themselves and how to do it.
Knowing how to study is especially important because college can only cover so much. Furthermore, a student&amp;rsquo;s career requirements may change.
Nothing is true simply because it is in a book. It must pass the test of one&amp;rsquo;s understanding. In case the understanding is beyond the student, they must perceive whether it&amp;rsquo;s mere fact, definition or opinion.</description>

      <description>Distinguish Mere Facts From Conclusions or Opinions Discriminate between mere statements of facts, necessary conclusions which follow therefrom, and mere opinions which they seem to render reasonable.
There&amp;rsquo;s no need to perform an experiment to verify that the atomic weight of oxygen is 16.
That the sum of the angles of a plane triangle equals two right angles is not a mere fact, but an inevitable truth.
Investigate the Reason For Facts Why would the wind in a storm in the northern hemisphere revolve counterclockwise around the storm&amp;rsquo;s center?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Suppose you dig a hole, hundreds of feet deep. Will the bottom be warmer or colder than the top?&amp;rdquo; Crickets. The teacher said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sure they know, but you&amp;rsquo;re not asking the right question.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;In what condition is the interior of the globe?&amp;rdquo; Half the class, &amp;ldquo;In a condition of igneous fusion!&amp;quot;
Terms like energy, momentum, rate of change, period of vibration, value, social justice, etc., are often used without a clear understanding.</description>

      <description>Discover the Fundamental Idea It helps you master the subject because the other details can be viewed in relation to the fundamental idea.
Facts of secondary importance may then be left for later readings.
Fundamental principles should frequently be memorized.
Lay Out Pre-Existing Knowledge Classify what you already know [and what you don&amp;rsquo;t know].
If you know nothing, insist on getting a clear idea of the subject, its extent, objects, methods, applications and relations to other subjects.</description>

      <description>Pick the best book. New to a subject? Start with the elementary one.
Study a few subjects at once, but not too many. The mind needs change of occupation, not idleness.
Weigh carefully before taking up or dropping a study. Read much but not many books.
Fix your mind intensely on one thing for a time long enough to make progress.
AKA &amp;ldquo;Deep Work&amp;rdquo;. The new old thing.
  Apply what you&amp;rsquo;re studying.</description>
