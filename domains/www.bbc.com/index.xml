      <description>&amp;ldquo;Apps&amp;rdquo; in this context means contact tracing apps released by public health authorities to do contact tracing. The APIs are limited to them.
  Big Picture  Release APIs to enable apps to interoperate between Android and iOS devices. [] Bluetooth-based contact tracing baked into Android and iOS, such that no app is needed for broadcasting/listening. [] This ensures broad adoption, but will be on an opt-in basis. []  Interesting debate for privacy, ethics and public health.</description>

      <description>Crows Could be the Smartest Animal Other Than Primates.  BBC. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191211-crows-could-be-the-smartest-animal-other-than-primates . Dec 11, 2019.  New Caledonian crows make hooked tools from soft twigs to scoop insects out of holes. Other animals that use tools: chimpanzees, parrots, alligators and crabs.
The crows found the desired stems even when they had been disguised with leaves from a different plant species.
There are anecdotes of crow intelligence too, e.g. using cars at a crosslight to crush cashews in Japan (more in this HN thread  )</description>
