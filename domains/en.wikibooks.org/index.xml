      <description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021: Sonar Sweep.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 18, 2022.  Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description>

      <description>Day 8 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 7, 2022.  Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description>
