      <title>AoC 2021 Day 01: Sonar Sweep</title>

      <description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021: Sonar Sweep.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 18, 2022.  Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description>

      <description>Day 2 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 19, 2022.  Problem Statement Part One Now, you need to figure out how to pilot this thing.
It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like forward 1, down 2, or up 3:
 forward X increases the horizontal position by X units. down X increases the depth by X units. up X decreases the depth by X units.</description>

      <description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 23, 2022.  Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 04: Giant Squid</title>

      <description>Day 4 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 25, 2022.  Part One You&amp;rsquo;re already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can&amp;rsquo;t see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
Maybe it wants to play bingo   ?</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 06: Lanternfish</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/Lanternfish/</link>

      <guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/Lanternfish/</guid>
      <description>Day 6 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 2, 2022.  Part I Description The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?
A massive school of glowing lanternfish swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe exponentially quickly? You should model their growth to be sure.
Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes.</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 07: The Treachery of Whales</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/TreacheryOfWhales/</link>

      <guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/TreacheryOfWhales/</guid>
      <description>Day 7 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 5, 2022.  Part I Description A giant whale has decided that your submarine is its next meal, and it&amp;rsquo;s much faster than you are. There&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to run!
Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it&amp;rsquo;s too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they&amp;rsquo;re aiming!</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 08: Seven Segment Search</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</link>

      <guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</guid>
      <description>Day 8 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 7, 2022.  Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description>
