      <description>Startups vs. Incumbents  Why Do Competitive Edges Die?
 Having a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking.

      <description>Humble Exits.  Morgan Housel. The Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/humble-exits/  . Oct 24, 2018.  Jack Welch declined $110m for a 10th season of Seinfeld because he was done with the show. He wanted to end the show on the same kind of peak.
The show was based on recreating real events from his and Larry David&amp;rsquo;s normal life. They were running out of material because it had been so long since they experienced a normal life.</description>

      <description>Immeasurably Important.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/  . Jul 5, 2018.  Filtering out information is an art, not a science, necessitated by the information overload that we live in.
 Watch out for the tendency to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world should be. If you think the world is all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about intuitively.</description>

      <description>The Psychology of Money.  Morgan Housel. The Collaborative Fund. http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/  . Jun 1, 2018.  People underestimate the role played by luck. Given \(N\) investors, if \(N\) is large enough, a couple of them will luck their way into billions.
But every investor seems to be doing due diligence. The successful ones will be more convinced that their methods really work.
Considering the amount of investing books out there, we should be seeing a lot more Warren Buffets in the world.</description>

      <description>Betting on Things That Never Change.  Morgan Housel. Collaborative Fund. https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/  . Jul 20, 2017.  Change by itself is hard. Investors have to spot it before it&amp;rsquo;s obvious. Consumers have to change their behaviors to make it viable. These two points repel each other.
Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>
