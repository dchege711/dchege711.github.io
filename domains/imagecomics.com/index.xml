  Volumes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9 have been nominated for the the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.  A 6/9 nomination rate implies that the comic is pretty good!
  Themes (Mostly War) Planet Landfall (Alana&amp;rsquo;s) and Wreath (its moon, Marko&amp;rsquo;s) have been in conflict as long as anyone can remember.</description>

      <description>Volume 9 was nominated for the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story or Comic. However, not very stoked after Book One (Vol 1 and 2). Maybe it gets better? Only Volume 9 has been nominated for a Hugo Award, so maybe check that next time before committing?
