      <description>The Dilemma There are wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones. Sackman et. al. found 10:1 ratios. The data showed no correlation between experience and performance.
The idea of a 10x developer is mostly ridiculed in my online circles. That said, some jobs have X years of experience as a requirement. How can we resolve these contradictions?
  The major part of the cost of large teams is communication, and system debugging to correct the ill effects of miscommunication.</description>

      <description>Unscoped (or Plain or C-Style) Enumerations Plain (or C-style) enums are entered in the same scope as the name of their enum, and implicitly convert to their integer value, e.g.
enum Color { red, green, blue }; int col = green; Color c2 = 1; // error: invalid conversion from &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;Color&amp;#39; [-fpermissive]  enum CardColor { red, black }; // Error: &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; conflicts with a previous declaration</description>

      <title>Observer</title>

      <description>notes that , the primary source, glosses over nitty-gritties. e.g. the &amp;ldquo;message queue&amp;rdquo; server. Maybe reading through these will provide a larger perspective to design decisions made in Chromium regarding observers.
   Rant: some of willchan&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on WeakPtr, for those who care to read   criticizes the observer pattern for murking dependency chains. Investigate more in this regard.
  Intent A one-to-many dependency between object so that when one object (subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and update automatically.</description>

      <description>One can use curl -v &amp;lt;url&amp;gt; to see all of the redirections and cookies set.  found that generating a tiny URL for Zoom links gives a URL that first goes to redirect.viglink.com.
I tried this on https://tinyurl.com/yyte6pqv, which points to https://www.c13u.com/socioeconomics/2020-11-21-experiments-in-social-economics/, but didn&amp;rsquo;t observe any 3rd party cookies. tinyurl.com did set a cookie, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably expected.
   proposes Federated Learning of Cohorts, which aims to enable ad-targeting based on people&amp;rsquo;s general browsing interest without exposing the exact browsing history.</description>
