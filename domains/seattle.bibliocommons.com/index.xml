      <description>Blood Is Another Word for Hunger.  Rivers Solomon. seattle.bibliocommons.com  . 2019.   Plot Points Sully slays slavers&#39; family after their patriarch dies in battle. She did not feel any remorse nor relief.
The etherworld thrived on the impermissible. A young and tender girl murdering a family, and maintaining her rage after the fact, was so impermissible that it cut a path between dominions.
The etherworld births a teenage Ziza (died 200 years prior) through Sully, and then later births four more revenants, for the five kills that she&amp;rsquo;d committed.</description>
