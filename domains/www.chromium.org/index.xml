Source: [statcounter | GlobalStats](#browserShare20092020) At the very least, Chrome is worth studying. Something worked out. I&amp;rsquo;m biased, I only plan to deeply explore Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
Stability, Testing and the Multi-Process Architecture In a single-threaded browser, devs use asynchronous APIs - which may sometimes hold the browser up. Instead of multiple threads, Chromium chose multiple processes: isolation, independent crashes, better asymptotic memory management, identifying expensive sites, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
