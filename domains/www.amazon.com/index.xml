      <description>The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.  Taleb, Nicholas Nassim. https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X  . Apr 17, 2007. ISBN: 978-1400063512.   I last read this book in June 2016. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I took poor notes, or if Taleb goes off on many tangents. 4 years later, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the takeaway is.</description>
