      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral?

Let’s tell representatives what their constituents think. Then they HAVE to vote with us!
 They don’t necessarily want to know what their constituents are thinking. When they do, they have no trouble finding out  Only a small fraction of citizens will ever participate in a poll, and that causes selection biases.</description>
