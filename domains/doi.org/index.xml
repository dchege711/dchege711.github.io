Finding out youâ€™re wrong means suffering a defeat. Seeks out evidence to fortify and defend your beliefs.
Directionally motivated reasoning. When we want something to be true, we ask, &amp;ldquo;Can I believe this?&amp;rdquo; When we don&amp;rsquo;t want something to be true, we ask, &amp;ldquo;Must I believe this?&amp;rdquo;
Scout Mindset Reasoning is like mapmaking. Finding out youâ€™re wrong means revising your map.</description></item><item><title>02.

The more objective you feel, the more you trust your own intuitions and opinions as accurate representations of reality, and the less inclined you are to question them.
Being smart and knowledgeable. It&amp;rsquo;s not a case of &amp;ldquo;if people were smarter and well-informed, they&amp;rsquo;d realize their errors&amp;rdquo;. For example, found that polarization (on political fronts) on anthropogenic climate change increases as scientific intelligence increases.</description></item><item><title>03.

Criticism of studies that argue that self-deception makes us happier: conflation of positive illusions and positive beliefs; unfounded definitions of what counts as self-deception; results that can be equally well-explained by something else.
There are alternative coping strategies that don&amp;rsquo;t involve self-deception: making a hypothetical plan about some unpleasant and unavoidable thing; noticing silver linings but not to the point of sweet lemons; admitting that things could be worse.</description></item><item><title>04.

However, a small subset of people (coined &amp;ldquo;superforecasters&amp;rdquo; ) were better. In a competition, they beat teams of top professors and CIA professional analysts. These superforecasters were not smarter than everyone else nor did they have more knowledge/experience, they were great at being wrong.
Change your mind a little at a time. Seeing the world in shades of grey is less stressful, as the experience of encountering evidence against one of your beliefs is not high stakes.</description></item><item><title>March</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/politics-and-governance/lewis-march/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/politics-and-governance/lewis-march/</guid><description>Growing Up in Segregated America Enlightening to see the struggles addressed by the civil rights movement through a child&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint. I can relate to John Lewis more at a young age because we have shared experiences, but his were in a segregated environment whereas mine weren&amp;rsquo;t.
The thing is, when I was young, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a civil rights movement.

The 3-voice Canon Per Tonos from Musikalisches Opfer BWV 1079 exhibits a strange loop. Successive modulations make one expect to hopelessly far from the starting key, but after six modulations, the original key of C minor is restored!

Initially rated myself based on % of completed daily objectives. The objectives didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily correspond to work items. Stopped because the numbers were high even on days when I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel productive.

Debugging involves inspecting a program&amp;rsquo;s internal state.
printf Debugging and Logging In printf debugging, one adds print statements and keeps iterating until enough information has been extracted.
Using logging has several advantages over printf debugging: varying logging destinations (e.g. standard output, files, sockets, remote servers, etc.); severity levels (e.g. INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &amp;amp;c) that support filtering of output; color-coding for readability.
Terminals have varying levels of color support: plain color; ANSI escape codes (16 color codes with bold/italic and background); 256 color palette; 24-bit truecolor (&amp;ldquo;888&amp;rdquo; colors, aka 16 million, e.</description></item><item><title>Software Engineering Journal Reviews</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-01-16-swe-journal-reviews/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-01-16-swe-journal-reviews/</guid><description>Formal Software Design Alloy is an open-source language and analyzer for software modeling.

General types of prediction tasks on graphs: graph-level (e.g. will a molecule bind to a receptor implicated in a disease?), node-level (e.g. what is the identity of each node?), and edge-level (e.g. does this edge exist; what value does it have?).

These affect (a) what data was selected, and (b) the labels assigned to the examples. They propose the \(\text{Fair-SMOTE}\) (Fair Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique) algorithm which (1) removes biased labels (via situation testing: if the model&amp;rsquo;s prediction for a data point changes once all of the data points' protected attributes are flipped, then that label is biased and the data point is discarded), and (2) rebalances internal distributions such that based on a protected attribute, examples are equal in both positive and negative classes.</description></item><item><title>Online Markets</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/2021-10-04-online-markets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/2021-10-04-online-markets/</guid><description>WWW &amp;lsquo;21: The Web Conference 2021 REST: Relational Event-Driven Stock Trend Forecasting REST, an event-driven stock trend forecasting framework, that overcomes two limitations of existing event-driven models.

They propose Cloak, which suppresses non-pertinent features (i.e. those features which can consistently tolerate addition of noise without degrading utility) to the prediction task. Cloak has a provable degree of privacy, and unlike cryptographic techniques, does not degrade prediction latency. Using the training data, labels, a pre-trained model and a privacy-utility knob, they (1) find the pertinent features through perturbation training, and (2) learn utility-preserving constant values for suppressing the non-pertinent data.</description></item><item><title>Software Dependencies</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2020-11-14-software-dependencies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2020-11-14-software-dependencies/</guid><description>Dependency Management Golang introduced a new library referencing mode to overcome limitations of the old one.
