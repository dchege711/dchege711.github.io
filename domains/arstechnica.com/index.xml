Sackman et. al. found 10:1 ratios. The data showed no correlation between experience and performance.
The idea of a 10x developer is mostly ridiculed in my online circles. That said, some jobs have X years of experience as a requirement. How can we resolve these contradictions?
The major part of the cost of large teams is communication, and system debugging to correct the ill effects of miscommunication.</description></item><item><title>Chrome vs. Everybody</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/www/2020-05-19-chrome-vs-everybody/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/www/2020-05-19-chrome-vs-everybody/</guid><description>Browser Market Share Worldwide (2009 - 2020). Source: [statcounter | GlobalStats](#browserShare20092020) At the very least, Chrome is worth studying. Something worked out. I&amp;rsquo;m biased, I only plan to deeply explore Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
Stability, Testing and the Multi-Process Architecture In a single-threaded browser, devs use asynchronous APIs - which may sometimes hold the browser up. Instead of multiple threads, Chromium chose multiple processes: isolation, independent crashes, better asymptotic memory management, identifying expensive sites, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
