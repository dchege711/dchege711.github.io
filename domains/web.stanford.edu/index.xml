Why isn&amp;rsquo;t every hash consistent by definition? For example, a map implementation would need consistent hashing lest it&amp;rsquo;s inaccurate when searching for stored values. Or is consistent hashing a tradeoff between collision-resistance and speed?
Web Caching Web caching was the original motivation for consistent hashing. With a web cache, if a browser requests a URL that is not in the cache, the page is downloaded from the server, and the result is sent to both the browser and the cache.</description></item><item><title>[ToDo] CS 168: The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/todo/computer-science/cs168-modern-algorithmic-toolbox/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/todo/computer-science/cs168-modern-algorithmic-toolbox/</guid><description>The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox (CS168).
