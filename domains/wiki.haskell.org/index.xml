and have Haskell solutions. It&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare how they solved the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up perfecting the wrong approach!
Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal and Stack are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 03: Binary Diagnostic</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</guid><description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 23, 2022. Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 06: Lanternfish</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/Lanternfish/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/Lanternfish/</guid><description>Day 6 - Advent of Code 2021. adventofcode.com . Accessed Mar 2, 2022. Part I Description The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?
A massive school of glowing lanternfish swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe exponentially quickly? You should model their growth to be sure.
Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 08: Seven Segment Search</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</guid><description>Day 8 - Advent of Code 2021. adventofcode.com . Accessed Mar 7, 2022. Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 09: Smoke Basin</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</guid><description>Multi-dimensional arrays using &lt;code>massiv&lt;/code>; Fusion; Box vs. Unboxed; Connected Components; &lt;code>Data.Set&lt;/code>; Monadic map</description></item><item><title>021.

If \(d(a) = b\) and \(d(b) = a\), where \(a \neq b\), then \(a\) and \(b\) are an amicable pair and each of \(a\) and \(b\) are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of \(220\) are \(1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110\); therefore \(d(220) = 284\).</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Parsing Arguments</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021Args/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021Args/</guid><description>Parsing the Command Line lists a couple of libraries. and are the most popular options.
