      <description>Tracking on the Internet   Screenshot from a 2012 study of third-party online tracking. The red boxes show content (at least the visible ones) served by third parties.
  When the browser requests a third-party resource embedded on a web page, the snippet below is a subset of the HTTP headers sent by the browser to the third party.
GET http://youtube.com/watch?v=gHStnhGx1P Cookie: id=35c192bcfe0000b1... Referer: http://www.nytimes.com/ The combination of the cookie and the referrer makes third-party tracking possible.</description>

      <description>Notes Mediocristan vs Extremistan: In Extremistan, one single observation can disproportionately affect the outcome.
Universa, a hedge fund made to exploit black swans, made 3,612% in March 2020 amidst the coronavirus crisis. Taleb is an advisor on the fund.  However, on a &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; day, Universa is always losing money.
  If finance were Gaussian, then the 2008 crash (more than 20 std) would take place every several billion lifetimes of the universe.</description>

      <description>On &amp;ldquo;Doing Your Research&amp;rdquo; Of late, the phrase &amp;ldquo;do your research&amp;rdquo; has been popular , with some pushing back claiming that lay people tend to entrench their initial opinions and should defer to the consensus of scientific experts . How does one spot the scientific consensus?
Maybe by surveying the publications   of the relevant field. Indexing and abstracting services provide abstracts of publications and references to documents , and may thus prove useful.</description>

      <description>Targeting Ads Based on Mood NYT&amp;rsquo;s nytDEMO launched perspective targeting, an ad product that allows advertisers to place ads based on the sentiment that the content is predicted to evoke . ESPN, USA Today, and Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Grapeshot have similar products too. 
How successful is this approach? Google, the largest online advertiser, does not mention it in their ads targeting help page   , but Google is not in the publishing business either.</description>
