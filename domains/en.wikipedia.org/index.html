A massive school of glowing lanternfish swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe exponentially quickly? You should model their growth to be sure.
Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes....</p></td></tr><tr class=no-decoration><td class=no-decoration>Feb 19, 2022</td><td class=no-decoration>&#187;</td><td class=no-decoration><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/haskell-meta/>Learning Haskell via AoC 2021</a>

Andrew Yao generalized 2PC for any feasible computation in 1986. Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson later generalized it to secure multiparty communication.
Yao-based protocols requires that the function to be securely evaluated be represented as a circuit, but an efficient transformation is not trivial....</p></td></tr><tr class=no-decoration><td class=no-decoration>Oct 2, 2017</td><td class=no-decoration>&#187;</td><td class=no-decoration><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/mathematics/probability/probability-and-stochastic-systems/02-bernoulli-processes/02-binomial-random-variable/>The Binomial Random Variable</a>

Git&rsquo;s interface is a leaky abstraction. While the interface is at times ugly, its underlying design and ideas are beautiful. A bottom-up explanation of Git therefore makes more sense.
