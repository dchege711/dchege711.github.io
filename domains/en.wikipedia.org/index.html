                        Bloated Dependencies A bloated dependency is one which is packaged in the application binary, but is not needed to run the application.
There are two levels to this: (1) a source file declares a dependency on foo but never actually uses foo, and (2) the application as a whole never uses foo. An optimal de-bloating solution would first address (1) and then tackle (2).
Some languages may have better tooling than others when it comes to automatically de-bloating their dependencies....

                        Formal Software Design Alloy is an open-source language and analyzer for software modeling. An Alloy model is a collection of constraints that describe a set of structures, e.g. all possible security configurations of a web application. Alloy&rsquo;s tool, the Alloy Analyzer is a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them. 

The Alloy Analyzer leverages a SAT solver, and this precludes Alloy from analyzing optimization problems....

                        Journals  note that prediction services can still make accurate predictions using a fraction of the data collected from a user device. They propose Cloak, which suppresses non-pertinent features (i.e. those features which can consistently tolerate addition of noise without degrading utility) to the prediction task. Cloak has a provable degree of privacy, and unlike cryptographic techniques, does not degrade prediction latency. Using the training data, labels, a pre-trained model and a privacy-utility knob, they (1) find the pertinent features through perturbation training, and (2) learn utility-preserving constant values for suppressing the non-pertinent data....

                        Link Prediction Given network-structured data, predict whether a link exists between two nodes.
General types of prediction tasks on graphs: graph-level (e.g. will a molecule bind to a receptor implicated in a disease?), node-level (e.g. what is the identity of each node?), and edge-level (e.g. does this edge exist; what value does it have?).

What is Modular Arithmetic? Where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, we can write:
$$ \frac{A}{B} = Q \text{ remainder } R $$
Using the same \(A, B, Q, \text{ and } R\) as above, we have:
$$ A \text{ mod } B = R $$
\(A \text{ mod } B\) can be visualized as taking \(A\) steps on a clock that runs from \(0\) to \(B-1\). If the number is positive we step clockwise, if it&rsquo;s negative we step counterclockwise....

                        State Surveillance In the aftermath of the Capitol insurrection, FBI was contacting people whose cellphones pinged cell towers near the Capitol during the riots. 
A powered mobile phone always sends signals to one of the closest base stations. Given multiple base stations, the angle and time of arrival, and location signatures of each cell location can be used to locate a mobile device. The higher the density of cell towers, the more precise the calculated location....

                        How to Be Wrong   found that experts were barely able to forecast better than random chance. However, a small subset of people (coined &ldquo;superforecasters&rdquo; ) were better. In a competition, they beat teams of top professors and CIA professional analysts. These superforecasters were not smarter than everyone else nor did they have more knowledge/experience, they were great at being wrong.
Change your mind a little at a time. Seeing the world in shades of grey is less stressful, as the experience of encountering evidence against one of your beliefs is not high stakes....

                        Environmentalism Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy.

                        Startups tend to fail more often than they succeed. However, a lot of startup advice is given by those who made it, and therefore prone to survivorship bias. Hearing from founders that gave it their all but never succeeded should be enlightening.
I expect reasons like misunderstanding the customer, sunk costs, running out of money (especially with societal pressures like a family to fend for), wrong time, etc.

                        On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs  Capitalism is meant to eliminate bullshit jobs, yet layoffs tend to fall on people making, moving, fixing and maintaining things, but not on the salaried paper pushers that effectively work 15 hours a week.
​From a political standpoint, a happy productive population with free time on their hands is mortal to the ruling class. Moreover, work is considered a moral value in itself....

                        Bloom Filters In true fashion to Stigler&rsquo;s Law of Eponymy (no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer ), Ross Ashby (1960) did a probabilistic analysis of Calvin Mooers&rsquo;s Zatocoding (1947) (coding system for library cards). This predates Burton Bloom&rsquo;s work (1970). 
  Motivation A Bloom filter for a set \(X: \{x_1, x_2, &hellip;, x_n\} \) from some universe \(\mathbb{U}\) allows one to test whether a given item \(x \in \mathbb{B}\) is an element of \(X\)....

                        Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.

                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene.

                        Societal Preference for STEM Over the Liberal Arts Not everyone can [wants to?] take the sciences, but they were pushed out of their passions into applicable degrees like Business and Communications. 
The initially high economic return to applied STEM degrees declines by more than 50% in the first decade. People who major in LA don&rsquo;t get first jobs that are as lucrative, but they do catch up. 
Governments tend to claim a shortage of STEM workers (who are valued for innovation and national defense), and allocate funds for increasing the student pipeline....

                        Timeline of Secure Multi-Party Communication  In 1982, secure two-party computation (2PC) was introduced for problems that are boolean predicates, e.g. Yao&rsquo;s Millionaires' Problem   that asks whether \(a \ge b\) is true without revealing the actual values of \(a\) and \(b\).
Andrew Yao generalized 2PC for any feasible computation in 1986. Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson later generalized it to secure multiparty communication.
Yao-based protocols requires that the function to be securely evaluated be represented as a circuit, but an efficient transformation is not trivial....

  At the very least, Chrome is worth studying. Something worked out. I&rsquo;m biased, I only plan to deeply explore Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
  Stability, Testing and the Multi-Process Architecture  In a single-threaded browser, devs use asynchronous APIs - which may sometimes hold the browser up. Instead of multiple threads, Chromium chose multiple processes: isolation, independent crashes, better asymptotic memory management, identifying expensive sites, etc....

                        Short Selling  Say $A shares are selling at $100, but I think they&rsquo;re overpriced. So I borrow 10 shares, pay my brokerage interest and post some collateral. I then sell the shares for $1,000.
Whoever buys my shares has no idea that I do not own them. In a naked short, I do not actually borrow or ensure that the security can be borrowed within the standard 3-day settlement period....

                        Money was a sore point in the Holmes household. Holmes&rsquo;s grandparents had squandered away their share of the Fleischmann fortune. Richard Fuisz, a family friend, was a flashy successful businessman.
So in a way, Elizabeth didn&rsquo;t grow up in wealth? This puts a spin on Chapter 01: A Purposeful Life  .
  Fuisz was offended that Elizabeth never consulted him. Fuisz made his money patenting medical inventions that he anticipated other companies would someday want....

                        \(X\) is a binomial random variable if it takes the values \(0, 1, 2, &hellip;, n\) and
$$ \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = { n \choose k } \cdot p^k \cdot (1 - p)^{n-k} $$
Sanity Check: Do the probabilities sum to 1? $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} { n \choose k } p^k (1 - p)^{n-k} = \left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n = 1 $$
I totally didn&rsquo;t understand how we got to \(\left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n\)....

                        Version Control Systems track changes to a folder and its contents in a series of snapshots. Each snapshot encapsulates the entire state of files/folders within a top-level directory.
Git&rsquo;s interface is a leaky abstraction. While the interface is at times ugly, its underlying design and ideas are beautiful. A bottom-up explanation of Git therefore makes more sense.
Snapshots A blob corresponds to a file, and it&rsquo;s just a bunch of bytes....
