From 1992 to 1997, murder rates dropped 64.3% to 770 and total crimes fell by \(\approx\) 50% to 355,893.
Geometric progressions are non-intuitive, e.g. if given a large paper and asked to fold it 50x, the stack&amp;rsquo;s height will be \(\approx\) the distance to the sun.

A row can be uniquely identified by a table + ID combination. A column entry can reference another row in another table through a shared key. One goal is to avoid duplicating data. However, to answer a real-world query, we end up paying th cost by joining results from multiple tables. That said, with proper indexing and prior research, combining results is pretty fast.</description></item><item><title>Intro to Design Patterns</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/gang-of-four-design-patterns/intro-to-design-patterns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/gang-of-four-design-patterns/intro-to-design-patterns/</guid><description>What Are Design Patterns? Arriving at designs that are specific to the problem at hand but general enough to address future problems and requirements is hard. New designers tend to be overwhelmed by the options available. Expert designers do not solve every problem from first principles; they reuse design patterns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also encountered the &amp;ldquo;you aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna need it&amp;rdquo; (YAGNI) school of thought that aims to minimize writing code that anticipates too far into the future, as such guesses usually don&amp;rsquo;t pan out.</description></item><item><title>01.

Andrew Yao generalized 2PC for any feasible computation in 1986. Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson later generalized it to secure multiparty communication.
Yao-based protocols requires that the function to be securely evaluated be represented as a circuit, but an efficient transformation is not trivial.</description></item><item><title>03.

printf Debugging and Logging In printf debugging, one adds print statements and keeps iterating until enough information has been extracted.
Using logging has several advantages over printf debugging: varying logging destinations (e.g. standard output, files, sockets, remote servers, etc.); severity levels (e.g. INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &amp;amp;c) that support filtering of output; color-coding for readability.

Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction?

​From a political standpoint, a happy productive population with free time on their hands is mortal to the ruling class. Moreover, work is considered a moral value in itself.</description></item><item><title>12.

Start investing early because compound interest and time are you greatest resource.
When it comes to setting saving accounts' interest rates with regard to the interest rate that banks enjoy from the fed , banks are downwards-flexible and upwards-sticky. Depositors lose the tune of $100b when interest rates are rising.

Stability, Testing and the Multi-Process Architecture In a single-threaded browser, devs use asynchronous APIs - which may sometimes hold the browser up. Instead of multiple threads, Chromium chose multiple processes: isolation, independent crashes, better asymptotic memory management, identifying expensive sites, etc.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/health-and-medicine/2020-05-06-covid-19/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/health-and-medicine/2020-05-06-covid-19/</guid><description>Contact Tracing &amp;ldquo;Apps&amp;rdquo; in this context means contact tracing apps released by public health authorities to do contact tracing.

However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.
