      <description>Introduction The Tipping Point is the biography of how little things had big effects.
From 1992 to 1997, murder rates dropped 64.3% to 770 and total crimes fell by \(\approx\) 50% to 355,893.
Geometric progressions are non-intuitive, e.g. if given a large paper and asked to fold it 50x, the stack&amp;rsquo;s height will be \(\approx\) the distance to the sun.
This is a popular illustration. The standard paper&amp;rsquo;s thickness, \(h_0\), is \(0.</description>

      <description>Incomplete List of Information Privacy Properties  Control/consent, e.g. Cambridge Analytica exfiltrating FB users&amp;rsquo; data   Discussion on Cambridge Analytica  
    Anonymity, e.g. Snowden leaking NSA docs without revealing his identity
  Limits on data collection, e.g. laws restricting government surveillance
  Limits on data use, e.g. US Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008
  Under GINA, health insurers must not use genetic information of the clients (or clients family) to inform their policy.</description>

      <title>The Binomial Random Variable</title>
      <link>https://www.c13u.com/mathematics/probability/probability-and-stochastic-systems/02-bernoulli-processes/02-binomial-random-variable/</link>

      <description>\(X\) is a binomial random variable if it takes the values \(0, 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, n\) and
$$ \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = { n \choose k } \cdot p^k \cdot (1 - p)^{n-k} $$
Sanity Check: Do the probabilities sum to 1? $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}\{X = k\} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} { n \choose k } p^k (1 - p)^{n-k} = \left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n = 1 $$
I totally didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how we got to \(\left( p + (1 - p) \right)^n\).</description>

      <description>The Law of the Few From 1995 to 1996, the # of children born in Baltimore with syphillis increased 500%. CDC blamed it on cocaine and reduction in clinics. []
In 100k+ Colorado Springs town, the gonorrhoea epidemic tipped because of the activities of 168 people living in 4 small neighbourhoods, frequenting the same 6 bars. []
GaÃ«tan Dugas, an Air-Canada flight attendant, is [mis?]regarded as &amp;ldquo;Patient Zero&amp;rdquo; for AIDS in the US.</description>

      <title>Contact Tracing for COVID-19</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Apps&amp;rdquo; in this context means contact tracing apps released by public health authorities to do contact tracing. The APIs are limited to them.
  Big Picture  Release APIs to enable apps to interoperate between Android and iOS devices. [] Bluetooth-based contact tracing baked into Android and iOS, such that no app is needed for broadcasting/listening. [] This ensures broad adoption, but will be on an opt-in basis. []  Interesting debate for privacy, ethics and public health.</description>

      <description>The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. []
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting [] 74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study.</description>
