Query statements are separated by a ;, and only affect the query at hand. There are 3 kinds of user query statements: tabular expression statements, let statements, and set statements.
The most common kind is the tabular expression statement where the input and the output consist of tables.</description></item><item><title>KQL: Common Operators</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/analyzing-datastores/kusto-common-operators/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/analyzing-datastores/kusto-common-operators/</guid><description>contains the database referenced in this document.
Count rows How many storm records are there in the table?
Count 59066 StormEvents | count
count returns a table with a single column and a single row containing the count of the remaining rows. The output is not a scalar value.

Dictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt; for quick look-up by key. List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; for accessing items by index. Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; for first-in-first-out (FIFO) access where the element is discarded after use. Stack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; for last-in-first-out (LIFO) access where the element is discarded after use. LinkedList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; for sequential access from either the head or the tail. ObservableCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; to receive notifications when items are removed/added. SortedList&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt; for a collection sorted by keys and accessible by either key or index.</description></item><item><title>Generic and Non-Generic Collection Interfaces in C#</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/collections/generic-and-non-generic-collections-csharp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/collections/generic-and-non-generic-collections-csharp/</guid><description>There are two main types of collections: non-generic (ICollection) and generic (ICollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;).
Non-generic collections only exist because .NET did not originally have generic data types. They shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used because:
They are untyped at compile time. The frequent casting from object and the actual type is error-prone; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to put the wrong type in the wrong collection. Value types need to be boxed as object, e.g., List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; stores its data in an int[], which is more performant than using object[] as that requires boxing.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2024 Day 04: Ceres Search</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2024/AoC2024/04-ceres-search/04-ceres-search/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2024/AoC2024/04-ceres-search/04-ceres-search/</guid><description>Problem This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words.

Attributes allow you to place extra descriptive information into metadata that can be extracted using runtime reflection services.
Example of reflection in C#: All types descended from the System.Object base class (the root of the type hierarchy in .NET) inherit the GetType() method.</description></item><item><title>Of Code Smells and Hygiene</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/miscellaneous/2020-07-05-code-smells-and-hygiene/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/miscellaneous/2020-07-05-code-smells-and-hygiene/</guid><description>#code-hygiene
Pick up from:
IEEE&amp;rsquo;s International Conference on Software Maintenance Improving Code: The (Mis)perception of Quality Metrics Springer&amp;rsquo;s Software Quality Journal On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way.</description></item></channel></rss>
