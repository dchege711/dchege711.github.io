Query statements are separated by a ;, and only affect the query at hand. There are 3 kinds of user query statements: tabular expression statements, let statements, and set statements.
The most common kind is the tabular expression statement where the input and the output consist of tables.</description></item><item><title>KQL: Common Operators</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/analyzing-datastores/kusto-common-operators/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/analyzing-datastores/kusto-common-operators/</guid><description>contains the database referenced in this document.
Count rows How many storm records are there in the table?
Count 59066 StormEvents | count
count returns a table with a single column and a single row containing the count of the remaining rows. The output is not a scalar value.

The serialized form doesn&amp;rsquo;t include any information about an object&amp;rsquo;s associated methods.
System.Text.Json emphasizes high performance and low memory allocation over an extensive feature set. It has built-in UTF-8 support because UTF-8 is the most prevalent encoding for data on the web and files on disk.

If not for my own productivity gains, then for having knowledgeable conversations with coworkers about using LLMs as a SWE.
Copilot-Powered Scenarios AI Code Completions I&amp;rsquo;ve found code completions more distracting than useful. Probably because I already have an idea of what I want to type, and Copilot&amp;rsquo;s hallucinations slow me down.</description></item><item><title>Attributes and Reflection in C#</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/meta-programming/dotnet-attributes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/meta-programming/dotnet-attributes/</guid><description>When you compile code for the runtime, it is converted into common intermediate language (CIL) and placed inside a portable executable (PE) file along with metadata generated by the compiler. Attributes allow you to place extra descriptive information into metadata that can be extracted using runtime reflection services.
Example of reflection in C#: All types descended from the System.Object base class (the root of the type hierarchy in .NET) inherit the GetType() method.</description></item><item><title>Of Code Smells and Hygiene</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/miscellaneous/2020-07-05-code-smells-and-hygiene/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/miscellaneous/2020-07-05-code-smells-and-hygiene/</guid><description>#code-hygiene
Pick up from:
IEEE&amp;rsquo;s International Conference on Software Maintenance Improving Code: The (Mis)perception of Quality Metrics Springer&amp;rsquo;s Software Quality Journal On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way.</description></item></channel></rss>
