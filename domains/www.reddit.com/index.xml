      <description>This page contains remarks on Haskell that I encountered when working with source files that span multiple AoC 2021 problems.
 and  have Haskell solutions. It&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare how they solved the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up perfecting the wrong approach!
