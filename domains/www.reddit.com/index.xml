and have Haskell solutions. It&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare how they solved the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up perfecting the wrong approach!
Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal and Stack are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 03: Binary Diagnostic</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</guid><description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021. adventofcode.com .
