While \(10^{100} + 1 - 10^{100} = 1\), iOS&amp;rsquo;s calculator gives back \(0\). explores how Android&amp;rsquo;s calculator gets this right courtesy of .
Real number representations are fundamentally imprecise because we can&amp;rsquo;t squeeze in infinitely many real numbers into a finite number of bits. Floating-point representations have a base \(\beta\) (assumed to be even) and a precision \(p\), e.g., if \(\beta = 10\) and \(p = 3\), then \(0.</description></item><item><title>Areas of Interest in Computer Science</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2021-04-12-interest-areas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2021-04-12-interest-areas/</guid><description>Maybe a good approximation is where Google Research is spending $$$
