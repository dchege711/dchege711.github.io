      <description>This page contains remarks on Haskell that I encountered when working with source files that span multiple AoC 2021 problems.
 and  have Haskell solutions. It&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare how they solved the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up perfecting the wrong approach!
Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal   and Stack   are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description>

      <description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021: Sonar Sweep.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 18, 2022.  Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description>

      <description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 23, 2022.  Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description>

      <description>Day 4 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 25, 2022.  Part One You&amp;rsquo;re already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can&amp;rsquo;t see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
Maybe it wants to play bingo   ?</description>
