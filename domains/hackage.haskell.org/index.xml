Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal and Stack are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 01: Sonar Sweep</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/SonarSweep/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/SonarSweep/</guid><description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021: Sonar Sweep. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 18, 2022. Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 03: Binary Diagnostic</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</guid><description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 23, 2022. Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 04: Giant Squid</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/GiantSquid/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/GiantSquid/</guid><description>Day 4 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 25, 2022. Part One You&amp;rsquo;re already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can&amp;rsquo;t see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
Maybe it wants to play bingo ?</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 08: Seven Segment Search</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</guid><description>Day 8 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Mar 7, 2022. Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 09: Smoke Basin</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</guid><description>Multi-dimensional arrays using &lt;code>massiv&lt;/code>; Fusion; Box vs. Unboxed; Connected Components; &lt;code>Data.Set&lt;/code>; Monadic map</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Parsing Arguments</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021Args/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021Args/</guid><description>Parsing the Command Line lists a couple of libraries. and are the most popular options.
