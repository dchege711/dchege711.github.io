Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal and Stack are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 01: Sonar Sweep</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/SonarSweep/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/SonarSweep/</guid><description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021: Sonar Sweep. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 18, 2022. Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description></item><item><title>02.

Adults tend to read non-fiction at 238 words per minute. So a good test for how appropriate a piece of writing is, &amp;ldquo;Can the writer cover X in N minutes?&amp;rdquo;
Hugo uses 213 WPM, while Medium uses 265 WPM, suggesting Medium has a bias for skimming over close reading.
I wonder if a browser extension that rates the appropriateness of articles given their subject and their word count is a feasible/desirable thing.</description></item><item><title>03.

Accessed Mar 7, 2022. Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 09: Smoke Basin</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</guid><description>Multi-dimensional arrays using &lt;code>massiv&lt;/code>; Fusion; Box vs. Unboxed; Connected Components; &lt;code>Data.Set&lt;/code>; Monadic map</description></item><item><title>021.

If \(d(a) = b\) and \(d(b) = a\), where \(a \neq b\), then \(a\) and \(b\) are an amicable pair and each of \(a\) and \(b\) are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of \(220\) are \(1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110\); therefore \(d(220) = 284\).</description></item><item><title>Debugging</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/debugging/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/debugging/</guid><description>Debugging 101 Definition? Debugging involves inspecting a program&amp;rsquo;s internal state.
printf Debugging and Logging In printf debugging, one adds print statements and keeps iterating until enough information has been extracted.
Using logging has several advantages over printf debugging: varying logging destinations (e.g. standard output, files, sockets, remote servers, etc.); severity levels (e.g. INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &amp;amp;c) that support filtering of output; color-coding for readability.
Terminals have varying levels of color support: plain color; ANSI escape codes (16 color codes with bold/italic and background); 256 color palette; 24-bit truecolor (&amp;ldquo;888&amp;rdquo; colors, aka 16 million, e.</description></item><item><title>Software Engineering Journal Reviews</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-01-16-swe-journal-reviews/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-01-16-swe-journal-reviews/</guid><description>Formal Software Design Alloy is an open-source language and analyzer for software modeling. An Alloy model is a collection of constraints that describe a set of structures, e.g. all possible security configurations of a web application. Alloy&amp;rsquo;s tool, the Alloy Analyzer is a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them.
ðŸ“‘ The Alloy Analyzer leverages a SAT solver, and this precludes Alloy from analyzing optimization problems.</description></item><item><title>Journal Reviews on Fairness</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/bias-and-fairness/2021-10-04-journal-reviews-on-fairness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/bias-and-fairness/2021-10-04-journal-reviews-on-fairness/</guid><description>Meta ðŸ“‘ Instead of changing the data or learners in multiple ways and then see if fairness improves, postulate that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that generated the training data. These affect (a) what data was selected, and (b) the labels assigned to the examples. They propose the \(\text{Fair-SMOTE}\) (Fair Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique) algorithm which (1) removes biased labels (via situation testing: if the model&amp;rsquo;s prediction for a data point changes once all of the data points' protected attributes are flipped, then that label is biased and the data point is discarded), and (2) rebalances internal distributions such that based on a protected attribute, examples are equal in both positive and negative classes.</description></item><item><title>LLMs: Stochastic Parrots ðŸ¦œ and How (Not) to Use Them</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/stochastic-parrots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/stochastic-parrots/</guid><description>was written in a period when NLP practitioners are producing bigger (# of parameters; size of training data) language models (LMs), and pushing the top scores on benchmarks.
