      <title>02. The Subject</title>

      <description>The Subject The number of words aren&amp;rsquo;t intuitive to me. Adults tend to read non-fiction at 238 words per minute.  So a good test for how appropriate a piece of writing is, &amp;ldquo;Can the writer cover X in N minutes?&amp;rdquo;
Hugo uses 213 WPM, while Medium uses 265 WPM, suggesting Medium has a bias for skimming over close reading. 
I wonder if a browser extension that rates the appropriateness of articles given their subject and their word count is a feasible/desirable thing.</description>

      <description>Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF) &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;http://bank.com/transfer?from=from_ID&amp;amp;to=to_ID&amp;amp;value=1000&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Because the user is logged in and has a cookie, the victim site trusts the user&amp;rsquo;s browser.
The attacker gets user/browser to execute command on victim site, e.g. request a link, post a form. The command has permanent effects.
A frame can navigate its immediate children. Why is it designed such that it can&amp;rsquo;t navigate its children too?
Consider a website with a login frame, where the user inputs passwords.</description>

      <description>Link to Original Video   ML Usefulness to a Dev  Reduce time spent programming, e.g. manually crafted spellchecker with rules of thumb vs. feeding ML model some examples.  How many words are there in English? Is it hard to have a huge set of all the possible words? How do spellcheckers do it?
Hunspell is the most popular OSS , and it was being used by Chromium , but on Chromium for Windows, the Windows Spellcheck is used .</description>

      <description>On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs  Capitalism is meant to eliminate bullshit jobs, yet layoffs tend to fall on people making, moving, fixing and maintaining things, but not on the salaried paper pushers that effectively work 15 hours a week.
â€‹From a political standpoint, a happy productive population with free time on their hands is mortal to the ruling class. Moreover, work is considered a moral value in itself.</description>
