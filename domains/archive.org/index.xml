      <description>Snow, Glass, Apples Stumbled onto  from Hoopla&amp;rsquo;s recommendations.  flips the script and tells the story from the step mother&amp;rsquo;s perspective, and she is also the protagonist.
  Snow White is a vampire. She fed on her father (consensually?), the King, to the point of him being a shadow of a man. Her stepmother, the Queen, was only 18 when the King died. The Queen had witnessed Snow White&amp;rsquo;s vampirism, and so she had a servant kill her by carving out her heart and dump her in the forest.</description>
