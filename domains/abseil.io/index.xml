      <description>quotes Doug McIlroy:
 Those types are not &amp;ldquo;abstract&amp;rdquo;; they are as real as int and float.
 What is the context of this quote?
  A class is a user-defined type provided to represent a concept in the code of a program. Essentially, all language facilities beyond the fundamental types, operators, and statements exist to help define better class or to use them more conveniently.</description>

      <description>Unscoped (or Plain or C-Style) Enumerations Plain (or C-style) enums are entered in the same scope as the name of their enum, and implicitly convert to their integer value, e.g.
enum Color { red, green, blue }; int col = green; Color c2 = 1; // error: invalid conversion from &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;Color&amp;#39; [-fpermissive]  enum CardColor { red, black }; // Error: &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; conflicts with a previous declaration</description>

      <description>Why Write Tests Helps catch bugs in the code, and in the programmer&amp;rsquo;s mental model of what the code does. 
  The later a bug is caught in the development cycle, the more expensive it is to fix it. A good test today is a future debugging session saved. 
The test is the first client of your code. It uncovers sub-optimal design choices, tight couplings, missed cases, etc.</description>

      <title>Resource Management in C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>Resource Handles RAII is also covered in Classes in C++ &amp;gt; Motivation for the Destructor Mechanism    The constructor/destructor pattern enables objects defined in a scope to release the resources during exit from the scope, even when exceptions are thrown. All standard-library containers, e.g. std::vector, are implemented as resource handles. 
std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr These &amp;ldquo;smart pointers&amp;rdquo; are useful in managing objects that are allocated on the free store (as opposed to those allocated on the stack).</description>
