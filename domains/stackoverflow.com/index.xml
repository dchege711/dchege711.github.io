A row can be uniquely identified by a table + ID combination. A column entry can reference another row in another table through a shared key. One goal is to avoid duplicating data. However, to answer a real-world query, we end up paying th cost by joining results from multiple tables. That said, with proper indexing and prior research, combining results is pretty fast.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 03: Binary Diagnostic</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</guid><description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 23, 2022. Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 09: Smoke Basin</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</guid><description>Multi-dimensional arrays using &lt;code>massiv&lt;/code>; Fusion; Box vs. Unboxed; Connected Components; &lt;code>Data.Set&lt;/code>; Monadic map</description></item><item><title>Classes in C++</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/type-systems/user-defined-types/classes-in-cpp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/language-concepts/type-systems/user-defined-types/classes-in-cpp/</guid><description>quotes Doug McIlroy:
Those types are not &amp;ldquo;abstract&amp;rdquo;; they are as real as int and float.
What is the context of this quote?
A class is a user-defined type provided to represent a concept in the code of a program. Essentially, all language facilities beyond the fundamental types, operators, and statements exist to help define better class or to use them more conveniently.</description></item><item><title>020.

For example, \(10! = 10 \times 9 \times &amp;hellip; \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800\), and the sum of the digits in the number \(10!\) is \(3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27\).
Find the sum of the digits in the number \(100!</description></item><item><title>Observer</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/gang-of-four-design-patterns/behavioral-patterns/07-observer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/gang-of-four-design-patterns/behavioral-patterns/07-observer/</guid><description>notes that , the primary source, glosses over nitty-gritties. e.g. the &amp;ldquo;message queue&amp;rdquo; server. Maybe reading through these will provide a larger perspective to design decisions made in Chromium regarding observers.
Rant: some of willchan&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on WeakPtr, for those who care to read criticizes the observer pattern for murking dependency chains. Investigate more in this regard.
Intent A one-to-many dependency between object so that when one object (subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and update automatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
