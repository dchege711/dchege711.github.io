      <description>Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&amp;rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&amp;rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy. 
Slots are increasingly designed for addiction, e.g. quick simple games, adding &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo;, more ways to win (and therefore more &amp;ldquo;near misses&amp;rdquo; if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t bet on the additional ways), losses disguised as wins, random but weighted outcomes.</description>

      <description>Choose your content. Some material not worth the effort. Learning comes from repetition, but sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. 
But even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. 
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions. Make flashcards of facts/quotes that you wish to analyze.</description>
