      <description>Tracking on the Internet   Screenshot from a 2012 study of third-party online tracking. The red boxes show content (at least the visible ones) served by third parties.
  When the browser requests a third-party resource embedded on a web page, the snippet below is a subset of the HTTP headers sent by the browser to the third party.
GET http://youtube.com/watch?v=gHStnhGx1P Cookie: id=35c192bcfe0000b1... Referer: http://www.nytimes.com/ The combination of the cookie and the referrer makes third-party tracking possible.</description>
