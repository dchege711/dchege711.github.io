      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/ . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674 . Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&amp;rsquo;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>Signal Is Finally Bringing Its Secure Messaging To the Masses.  Andy Greenberg. https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/ . https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/02/14/2216214/signal-is-finally-bringing-its-secure-messaging-to-the-masses#comments . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22326731 . Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&amp;rsquo;d think that at Signal&amp;rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon.</description>

      <title>Reading and Writing to Know</title>

      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. []
But even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>

      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &amp;ldquo;Life After Hate&amp;rdquo; suggested to them. []
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?</description>

      <title>APIs Are Not In the Efficiency Business</title>

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94% [] Google Directions API limited their free tier  . CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>

      <title>Theory About Theories</title>

      <description>On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&amp;rsquo;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read.</description>

 STEM in early education is unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds Lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education Hostile university culture in male-dominated CS programs Biased hiring practices Non-inclusive work environments cause higher churn of underrepresented folk.</description>

      <description>Why I Love B2B over B2C.  Justin Kan. Atrium. https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/ . Jul 11, 2018.  B2B customers will actually pay for your product. You have a clear execution path - they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&amp;rsquo;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>
