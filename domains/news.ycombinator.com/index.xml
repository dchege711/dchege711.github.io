How can I use them to enhance my capabilities?
Look out for the Gell-Man amnesia effect. You prompt the LLM on some subject you know well. You read the response and see the LLM has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in the response, and then ask it about something else, and read the response as if it&amp;rsquo;s more accurate than the baloney you just read.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Integration Tooling</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/flashcards-app/ci-tooling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/flashcards-app/ci-tooling/</guid><description>What automatic tools can I add to keep code quality high?
CodeQL CodeQL is a tool that runs variant analysis on code. The idea is that we create a query from a known vulnerability, e.g., SQL injection, and then run it against a codebase to find instances of that vulnerability. GitHub authorizes the use of CodeQL for public repos, and so we are covered . ql-analysis.sh has a recipe for running the analysis locally in the repo.</description></item><item><title>Markup Features</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/flashcards-app/markup-features/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/flashcards-app/markup-features/</guid><description>Syntax Highlighting Previously, we&amp;rsquo;d highlight code on the client by loading src/lib/highlight.pack.js, a bundle downloaded from but served from our domain, and then execute hljs.highlightBlock on demand, e.g., on page load, when showing a card, etc. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with a web-component-centric design.

LLVM Core libraries provide an optimizer and code generator for different CPUs. Clang is an &amp;ldquo;LLVM native&amp;rdquo; C/C++/Objective-C compiler which aims for fast compilation, useful error and warning messages, and a platform for building source-level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer and clang-tidy are examples of such tools.
So if I were to create a programming language, I can define a transformation into LLVM intermediate representation (LLVM IR), and that will make use of LLVM core to optimize it?</description></item><item><title>Testing Your Code</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-06-11-testing-your-code/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2022-06-11-testing-your-code/</guid><description>Why Write Tests Helps catch bugs in the code, and in the programmer&amp;rsquo;s mental model of what the code does.
The later a bug is caught in the development cycle, the more expensive it is to fix it. A good test today is a future debugging session saved.
The test is the first client of your code.

The architectural choices and bugs in the implementation tend to be more impactful, so focus more on those.
Be conservative in what you consider technical debt. It should be something that slows down current/future changes, and not code that doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;feel nice&amp;rdquo;. A code base that is free if technical debt is likely over-emphasizing polish over delivery.
Abstractions and indirections in the name of future-proofing tend to be wrong especially when treading new paths, where you can&amp;rsquo;t reliably predict the future.</description></item><item><title>Projects That Never Made It</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/on-starting-a-business/2021-12-24-projects-that-never-made-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/business/on-starting-a-business/2021-12-24-projects-that-never-made-it/</guid><description>Startups tend to fail more often than they succeed.
