      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/ . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674 . Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&amp;rsquo;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&amp;rsquo;d think that at Signal&amp;rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon.</description>

      <description>MUST and MUST NOT; On Writing Documentation []   Revise documentation, many times, and on separate days to catch confusing parts.
  Beware of ambiguities, e.g. X may not do Y. Refer to definitions, e.g. RFC 2119  .
  Put yourself into different roles, e.g. the person just looking for samples, the person who wants to read up on every nook and crany, the person who has no technical background etc.</description>

      <description>20 years later, JetBrains is valued at $7b without taking VC money. HN users praise JetBrains for being user-focused, and the prevailing argument is that VC money comes with growth-hacking attached. []
Is the Lean Startup Dead? Katzenberg (Paramount, Disney Studios &amp;amp; DreamWorks) has raised $1.75b for NewTV, a startup banking on consumers wanting a subscription for 10-minute programs on mobile.
They renamed to quibi.com/  . At least that makes them more searchable on Google.</description>

      <description>On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way. []

      <description>Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;ll remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. []
But even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions.</description>

      <description>Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &amp;ldquo;Life After Hate&amp;rdquo; suggested to them. []
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?</description>

Foundations are more effective than governments as they do their due diligence, e.g. Bill Gates. Reforming the government is a long battle.

      <description>Protectionism vs. Globalization Prestige Ameritech is America&amp;rsquo;s #1 maker of surgical masks. In outbreaks, demand peaks, but when it&amp;rsquo;s all over, hospitals go back to exclusively buying cheaper masks from China. Reduced demand makes Ameritech lay off workers. Ameritech is pushing for a federal contract to stabilize demand over time. []

      <description>CityFlo Reduces Google Maps API Bill by 94% [] Google Directions API limited their free tier  . CityFlo uses this API to calculate ETAs. Initially, CityFlo queried the API every time a stop was registered.
This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&amp;rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!</description>

      <description>On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&amp;rsquo;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read.</description>

You have a clear execution path - they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you and pay for features. Companies don&amp;rsquo;t quickly flip flop between products. Consumers are too price sensitive and finicky.
B2B customers are rational, and thus understandable. They care about whether a solution solves their problem and if the solution is important enough to pay for.</description>
