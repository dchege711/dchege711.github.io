                        On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way. []

                        Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;ll remember what you&rsquo;ve read. []
But even if you don&rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions....
