      <description>On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble.

      <description>Facebook Monetizing Encrypted Messaging by Analyzing Metadata.  @SarahJamieLewis. https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1088914192847917056. Jan 25, 2019.  Claim: FB will track relationships and social groups and make that information accessible to law enforcement. FB is a corporation that needs to make money; surveillance makes them money.
Contention: Actual privacy and security must protect metadata as well as content.
Cwtch by OpenPrivacy aims to minimize metadata exposed by apps used. It&#39;s built on Tor. Challenges: message latency, server reliability &amp;amp; discovery, (online) first contact problem for key exchange.</description>
