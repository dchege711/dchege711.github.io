Node-based frameworks would require too much shimming of DOM calls that&amp;rsquo;d make the tests unrepresentative. and are good options for browser-based testing.

The later a bug is caught in the development cycle, the more expensive it is to fix it. A good test today is a future debugging session saved.
The test is the first client of your code. It uncovers sub-optimal design choices, tight couplings, missed cases, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
