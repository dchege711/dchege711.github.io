<i class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" aria-hidden=true></i>Accessed Jan 19, 2026.</div><p><em>Scalable Web Architecture and Distributed Systems</em>. Key issues to
consider when designing large websites, and some of the building blocks used to
achieve these goals.</p><p><em>Firefox Release Engineering</em>. Scripts and infrastructure decisions that
comprise the complete Firefox rapid release system. Starting with builds and
code signing, then customized partner and localization repacks, the QA process,
and how we generate updates for every supported version, platform, and
localization.</p><p><em>FreeRTOS</em>. Like all OSs, FreeRTOS&rsquo;s main job is to run tasks. Unlike all
OSs, FreeRTOS is a real-time OS which runs on embedded systems.</p><p><em>GDB, the GNU Debugger</em>. The overall internal structure of GDB, showing
how it has gradually developed as new user needs and new features have come in
over time.</p><p><em>The Glasgow Haskell Compiler</em>. Over its lifetime, GHC has generally had
2-3 active developers. While GHC is stuffed full of cutting-edge research ideas,
a great deal of effort us put into ensuring that it can be relied on for
production use. We present an overview of GHC&rsquo;s architecture, and a focus on
some key ideas that have been successful in GHC, and a few that haven&rsquo;t.</p><p><em>Git</em>. How various aspects of Git work under the covers to enable
distributed workflows, and how it differs from other version control systems
(VCSs).</p><p><em>GPSD</em>. A suite of tools for managing collections of GPS devices and
other sensors related to navigation and precision timekeeping. GPSD has
historically had an exceptionally low defect rate. The project has been very
aggressive about incorporating technology for automated testing.</p><p><em>The Dynamic Language Runtime and the Iron Languages</em>. Iron languages,
e.g., IronPython, are dynamic languages that target the Common Language Runtime
(CLR), and they are built on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). Details
on call sites, binders, adaptive compilation, and other techniques used to make
dynamic languages perform nearly as fast as static languages on a platform that
was designed for static languages.</p><p><em>ITK, the Insight Toolkit</em>. A library of image analysis algorithms for
image filtering, image segmentation, and image registration.</p><p><em>GNU Mailman</em>. Free software for managing mailing lists. Problematic
design decisions in Mailman 1 and 2, and their solutions in Mailman 3. Two
overriding principles: no message should ever be lost; no message should ever be
delivered more than once.</p><p><em>matplotlib</em>. A Python-based plotting library with full support for 2D
and limited support for 3D graphics. Can embed graphics in UI toolkits, with
interactivity on GTK+, Qt, Tk, FLTK, wxWidgets and Cocoa. Can be called
interactively from the interactive Python shell. Can be embedded in a headless
web-server to provide hardcopy.</p><p><em>MediaWiki</em>. Running on a top-ten website (100,000+ hits per second) on a
shoestring budget. Heavy bias towards performance, caching, and optimization.
Unlike generic CMSs, MediaWiki aims to support a community creating and curating
freely reusable knowledge on an open platform.</p><p><em>Moodle</em>. A site where students and teachers can come together to teach
and learn. How the application is divided into plugins. The permissions system
that controls which users can perform which actions in different parts of the
system. The output generation with support for themes and localization. The
database abstraction layer.</p><p><em>nginx</em>. A free open source web server focused on high performance, high
concurrency, and low memory usage. Additional features include load balancing,
caching, access and bandwidth control, and the integrations with a variety of
applications.</p><p><em>Open MPI</em>. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) describes the reliable
transfer of discrete, typed messages between MPI processes. MPI implementations
are typically used in high-performance computing environments where input data
sets are too much for just one server and MPI jobs are spread out across many
servers working in concert to solve one computational problem.</p><p><em>Open Source Clinical Application Resource (OSCAR)</em>. An electronic
medical record (EMR) system that permits the digitization of a patient chart,
making it easier for a physician to deliver care. OSCAE has many subsystems that
provide functionality on a component-by-component basis.</p><p><em>Processing.js</em>. The Processing programming language offers a highly
simplified model for 2D and 3D graphics. Processing.js brings it to the web
without the need for Java or plugins.</p><p><em>Puppet</em>. An ope source IT management tool written in Ruby, used for
datacenter automation and server management. One of the guiding goals is to have
the work it does make sense whether you&rsquo;re looking at Puppet code or the system
itself.</p><p><em>PyPy</em>. A Python implementation and a dynamic language implementation
framework. Its powerful abstractions make it the most flexible Python
implementation.</p><p><em>SQLAlchemy</em>. A database toolkit and object-relational mapping (ORM)
system for Python. Provide an end-to-end system for working with relational
databases in Python, using the Python Database API (DBAPI) for database
interactivity.</p><p><em>Twisted</em>. An event-driven (a programming paradigm in which program flow
is determined by external events) networking engine in Python.</p><p><em>Yesod</em>. A web framework written in Haskell. Exploits the static nature
of Haskell to produce safer, faster code.</p><p><em>The Yocto Project</em>. An open source project that provides a common
starting point for developers of embedded Linux systems to create customized
distributions for embedded products in a hardware-agnostic setting.</p><p><em>ZeroMQ, ØMQ</em>. A messaging system for applications. Extreme optimization
for use as an ultra-fast messaging system for stock trading. A generic system
for building distributed applications and supporting arbitrary messaging
patterns, various transport mechanisms, arbitrary language bindings. Improving
usability and flattening the learning curve.</p></article><div style=font-size:smaller><aside id=domains-holder style="margin:0 0 2%">Cited Domains:
