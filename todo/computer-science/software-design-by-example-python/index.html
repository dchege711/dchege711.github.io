<i class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" aria-hidden=true></i>Accessed Jan 20, 2026.</div><p><em>Objects and Classes</em>. What is a natural way to represent real-world
&ldquo;things&rdquo; in code, and how can we organize that code so that it&rsquo;s easier to
understand, test, and extend?</p><p><em>Finding Duplicate Files</em>. Comparing each file to others is unworkably
slow for large sets of files. How about generating a short label that depends
only on the file contents and comparing that instead?</p><p><em>Matching Patterns</em>. Implement the filename matching used in the Unix
shell to show how more complicated tools like regular expressions work.</p><p><em>Parsing Text</em>. Build a parser for the simple filename matching patterns
implemented in the previous chapter.</p><p><em>Running Tests</em>. How tools to collect tests, run them, and report their
results are built. Highlights the idea that programs are just another kind of
data.</p><p><em>An Interpreter</em>. A program in memory is just a data structure, each of
whose elements trigger some operation in the interpreter that&rsquo;s executing it.
Build a simple interpreter and evaluate the design by asking how extensible it
is.</p><p><em>Functions and Closures</em>. Extends the little interpreter to allow
function definitions. Shows that handling variable scope is a design choice. How
closures enable programs to encapsulate information in useful ways.</p><p><em>Protocols</em>. How to simplify testing by temporarily replacing real
functions with ones that return predictable values. Motivate ways that
programmers can hook their own code into the Python interpreter.</p><p><em>A File Archiver</em>. Explore the core of a simple version control system by
building a file archiver that avoids creating duplicates of the same files.</p><p><em>An HTML Validator</em>. Build a tool to check the structure of web pages.
Introduces a design pattern frequently used to manage irregular data structures.</p><p><em>A Template Expander</em>. Build a simple static site generator to show how
modern websites create pages from templates. Reinforces earlier lessons about
creating little programming languages.</p><p><em>A Code Linter</em>. How one program can check the structure of another.
Remember, programs are just another kind of data.</p><p><em>Page Layout</em>. Build a small HTML layout engine that takes text and
formatting instructions, and decides where to put each character and image.
Introduces ideas about recursion and multiple inheritance.</p><p><em>Performance Profiling</em>. Implement the kind of multi-column table used in
data science to enforce the value of abstraction and how systematic performance
testing can be used to decide between different implementation strategies.</p><p><em>Object Persistence</em>. Complex data structures require a framework capable
of handling aliasing and circularity. Build such a framework and learn how
libraries for handling JSON and other formats work.</p><p><em>Binary Data</em>. High-level programming languages abstract away bits and
bytes, but sooner or later, the abstraction breaks down. Explore how computers
represent numbers and text.</p><p><em>A Database</em>. Build a simple database that appends every new copy of a
record to a running log of operations.</p><p><em>A Build Manager</em>. Build a simple build manager. Introduce some
fundamental algorithms on directed graphs.</p><p><em>A Package Manager</em>. How to find a workable installation of packages or
prove that there isn&rsquo;t one.</p><p><em>Transferring Files</em>. Build a simple low-level client-server program to
move files from one machine to another.</p><p><em>Serving Web Pages</em>. Build a simple web server that understands the
basics of HTTP and how to test programs of this kind.</p><p><em>A File Viewer</em>. Build a tool for viewing files. Moving a cursor,
inserting and deleting characters, etc., are not covered.</p><p><em>Undo and Redo</em>. Modify the file viewer from the preceding chapter to
add and delete text, and implement the undo design pattern.</p><p><em>A Virtual Machine</em>. Build a simulator of a small computer and an
assembler for a very simple language that can be used to program it.</p><p><em>A Debugger</em>. Build a simple single-stepping debugger for the virtual
machine of the previous chapter. Show how we can test it and other interactive
applications.</p></article><div style=font-size:smaller><aside id=authors-holder style="margin:0 0 2%">Cited Authors:
