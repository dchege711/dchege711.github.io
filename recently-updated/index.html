                        Medical care is like the opposite of moving fast and breaking things. If it&rsquo;s so taboo to admit error, then that could make errors more common because fewer people are learning from past errors.

  Internal norms derive from a cognitive pursuit of science. They are:

                        Method of Definition: Prototype Semantics There is a cognitive science view of categorization that says:
 Category members need not necessarily share a single set of distinguishing features, and may exhibit features to greater/lesser degrees Some category members are more typical than others  This reasoning goes against how I mentally picture a category.
  Although lies may have identifiable features such as misrepresentation of belief, intent to deceive, falseness and reprehensible motives, not all features are always present, and not all features are equally prominent in every instance....

Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &lsquo;do everything&rsquo;, but often they mean &lsquo;do everything that’s reasonable.&rsquo; But they may not know what’s reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish....

Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &ldquo;10,000 hours rule&rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts. 
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.
