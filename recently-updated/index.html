                        Mergeable Replicated Data Types [] On a distributed system, each replica should [eventually] converge to the same state. Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) can accept updates and achieve consistent without remote synchronization.
The Need for Commutativity Say we have a queue \( 1 \to 2 \). Suppose two replicas, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), independently call pop(). Each replica will have \(2\) on their queue.
However, on receiving an update that the other replica popped, each replica will call pop() to be consistent, thereby deleting \(2\)....

                        La Mattanza: An ancient Silician ritual in which fisherman waded into the Mediterranean Sea up to their waist with clubs and spears and then stood still for hours on end until the [bluefin tuna] no longer noticed their presence. Eventually, when enough [tuna] had gathered around them, someone gave and imperceptible signal and in a split second the scene went from preternatural quiet to gory bloodbath as the fishermen struck viciously at their unsuspecting quarry....

                        Unfalsifiable but favorable propositions invite baloney. For example, one might want to believe in life after death, without being interested in evidence for it. However, one shouldn&rsquo;t validate the pretensions of mediums on such a belief.
 The LeftOvers (TV Series)   explores this a bit. John pretends to be a medium, but actually has a hidden mic and earpiece to Laurie, who then searches the internet for details on the person of interest....
