                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. 
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting  74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study....

                        Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &ldquo;Life After Hate&rdquo; suggested to them. 
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?...

                        But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in intensified form. The language becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easy for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible.
Standard phrases already have rhythm. They are a convenient shortcut for lazy communicators.
Pretentious diction to make the banal appear profound, the biased seem scientifically impartial and sordid events masquerade as dignified....

If a part meets something repulsive, like light, it pulses more slowly and shrinks.

Dec 11, 2019.  New Caledonian crows make hooked tools from soft twigs to scoop insects out of holes. Other animals that use tools: chimpanzees, parrots, alligators and crabs.
The crows found the desired stems even when they had been disguised with leaves from a different plant species.
There are anecdotes of crow intelligence too, e.g. using cars at a crosslight to crush cashews in Japan (more in this HN thread  )...

                        Return the Average Value One possible solution is to return the average value in the neighborhood, i.e.
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i $$
We can improve this by using weighted \(k-NN\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} \cdot t_i \right) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} } $$
The formula looks new. However, if \(x_1\) is weighted by \(w_1\) and \(x_2\) by \(w_2\), then the weighted average is:
$$ \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 }{w_1 + w_2} $$...

                        When you have features taking different range if values, you may have odd predictions.
For example, if \(f_1 \in [0, 100]\) and \(f_2 \in [0, 1]\), \(f_1\) will always be penalized more than \(f_2\) when computing the distance.
  To mitigate this, normalize the feature&rsquo;s ranges to \([r_{low}, r_{high}]\):
$$ a'_i = \frac{a_i - a_{min}}{ a_{max} - a_{min}} \cdot (r_{high} - r_{low}) + r_{low} $$
Typically, the range is normalized to \([r_{low}, r_{high}] = [0, 1]\), so range normalization simplifies to:...

                        Majority Voting The \(k\) nearest neighbors model predicts the target level from the majority vote from the set of the \(k\) nearest neighbors to the query \(q\).
Where \(\delta\) is an indicator function such that \(\delta(t_i, l) = 1 \iff t_i = l\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k} (q) = argmax_{l \in levels(t)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \delta(t_i, l) \right) $$
For categorical features, \(k\) should be odd to avoid ties.
This doesn&rsquo;t read right. If there are 3 possible categories, \(k = 3\) can result in a tie....

                        Similarity-based learning is intuitive and gives people confidence in the model.
There is an inductive bias that instances that have similar descriptive features belong to the same class.
Remarkably so. When I think of classifying things, my mind immediately goes to NN.
  Similarity learning has a stationary assumption, i.e. the joint PDF of the data doesn&rsquo;t change (new classifications do not come up). This assumption is shared by supervised ML....
