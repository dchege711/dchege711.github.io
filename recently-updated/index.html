                        On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way. []

                        Momentum involves giving the reader adequately developed and reasonably arranged material for a smooth ride.
Rereading your own prose will not always disclose gaps since you may unconsciously fill them.

                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. []
