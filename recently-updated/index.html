                        Eternals (2006) by Neil Gaiman. Image from marvel.com
  Mark Evanier: Can you prove that ancient civilizations weren&rsquo;t visited by space travellers and heralded as gods? Did those aliens alight on this planet eons ago and plant the seeds of our civilization?
The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of Engineers.
  Jack Kirby, 1976: I feel that playing around with this sort of conjecture is highly entertaining, and that we should aim our gunsights at this giant puzzle we&rsquo;ve inherited more often....

                        The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)

                        You need to develop a broad spectrum of style and then be able to move from one end of the spectrum to the other as occasion demands. You&rsquo;ll develop a basic style but inability to diversify is being like a baller with a drive but no jump shot. Questions to ask: What am I writing about? Who will read what I&rsquo;ve written? Why did I write it?   I&rsquo;m writing about topics that I want to know more about....

If only \(x\%\) of people pay you back, then \(\frac{x}{100}(1 + r) \ge 1 \) suggests \(r \ge \frac{100}{x} - 1 \). If \(75\%\) tend to pay back, \(r = 33\frac{1}{3} \%\)....

                        Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.

                        10,000 Hours, YMMV  10,000 hours introduced here  
  10,000 hours has been lauded by popular authors, e.g. Malcolm Gladwel&rsquo;s Outliers, and Geoff Colvin&rsquo;s Talent is Overrated. Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &ldquo;10,000 hours rule&rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts. 
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.
A cross-sectional study is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population (or a representative subset) at a specific point in time....

Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else Glance at the math to determine the underlying theoretical foundations Read the conclusions. Mentally tick off references that you&rsquo;ve already read.  Most of the papers will not make it beyond this step....
