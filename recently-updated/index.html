                        Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.

  The Four Color Theorem does not claim that 4 colors suffice to color a planar map. Instead, 4 colors are sufficient to color any planar graph so that no two vertices connected by an edge are colored with the same color. For any \(n\), there is a map that requires at least \(n\) colors....

                        10,000 Hours, YMMV  10,000 hours introduced here  
  10,000 hours has been lauded by popular authors, e.g. Malcolm Gladwel&rsquo;s Outliers, and Geoff Colvin&rsquo;s Talent is Overrated. Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &ldquo;10,000 hours rule&rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts. 
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.
A cross-sectional study is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population (or a representative subset) at a specific point in time....

                        Eternals (2011) by Neil Gaiman
  Mark Evanier: Can you prove that ancient civilizations weren&rsquo;t visited by space travellers and heralded as gods? Did those aliens alight on this planet eons ago and plant the seeds of our civilization?
The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of Engineers.
  Jack Kirby, 1976: I feel that playing around with this sort of conjecture is highly entertaining, and that we should aim our gunsights at this giant puzzle we&rsquo;ve inherited more often....

                        Classifying mathematics by its subject matter may be misleading because the kinds of questions being asked may be the same, despite different subject matter.
Does it then imply that questions in math can be approached through any technique, but some techniques are simply more efficient than others?
  Nonetheless, classifying by subject matter, we crudely have algebra, geometry and analysis.
Algebra vs. Geometry It&rsquo;s insufficient to claim that algebra contains symbols, while arithmetic contains numbers....

Wiliam Dawes also had a ride. But the local militia leaders weren&rsquo;t alerted. Few people came out to fight the British....
