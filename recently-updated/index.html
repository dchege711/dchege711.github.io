With relative cursors, we have URLs like example.com/items?limit=50&amp;lastID=XXX, which leads to SQL like SELECT * from 'items' WHERE 'id' &gt; XXX ORDER BY 'id' ASC LIMIT 50, and this is more efficient, assuming there are indexes for id....

                        Classifying mathematics by its subject matter may be misleading because the kinds of questions being asked may be the same, despite different subject matter.
Does it then imply that questions in math can be approached through any technique, but some techniques are simply more efficient than others?
  Nonetheless, classifying by subject matter, we crudely have algebra, geometry and analysis.
Algebra vs. Geometry It&rsquo;s insufficient to claim that algebra contains symbols, while arithmetic contains numbers....

                        The Midnight Ride  Afternoon of April 18, 1775: Paul Revere, a silversmith, got word of British planning to raise hell the next day.
Revere goes out informing people. Churchbells and drums. Those informed by Revere send out riders of their own.
In Concord, the colonial militia soundly beat the British, kicking off the American Revolution.
Wiliam Dawes also had a ride. But the local militia leaders weren&rsquo;t alerted. Few people came out to fight the British....

                        Choose your content. Some material not worth the effort. Learning comes from repetition, but sometimes you just don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;ll remember what you&rsquo;ve read. 
But even if you don&rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. 
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions. Make flashcards of facts/quotes that you wish to analyze....

                        Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy. 
Slots are increasingly designed for addiction, e.g. quick simple games, adding &ldquo;near misses&rdquo;, more ways to win (and therefore more &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; if one doesn&rsquo;t bet on the additional ways), losses disguised as wins, random but weighted outcomes....
