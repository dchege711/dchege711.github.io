The attacker gets user/browser to execute command on victim site, e.g. request a link, post a form. The command has permanent effects.

The Startup Idea Matrix, ( B2B Edition  , B2C Edition  ) is a good start for knowing who to google.

                        Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy. 
Slots are increasingly designed for addiction, e.g. quick simple games, adding &ldquo;near misses&rdquo;, more ways to win (and therefore more &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; if one doesn&rsquo;t bet on the additional ways), losses disguised as wins, random but weighted outcomes....

                        Consultants are not well suited for strategy (you probably have a deeper understanding). They are also an expensive way of proving your point to management. However, they are good for emergency horsepower, e.g. data analysis, and for primary research within your industry (they probably have a broader understanding). 
Having a competitive advantage may reduce the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking....

Admittedly, these are things that the government should be doing, but it seems that the government doesn&rsquo;t do enough. Furthermore, some of these issues so politicized, e.g. immigrants, that government support can be fickle.

                        Eternals (2006) by Neil Gaiman. Image from marvel.com
  Mark Evanier: Can you prove that ancient civilizations weren&rsquo;t visited by space travellers and heralded as gods? Did those aliens alight on this planet eons ago and plant the seeds of our civilization?
The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of Engineers.
  Jack Kirby, 1976: I feel that playing around with this sort of conjecture is highly entertaining, and that we should aim our gunsights at this giant puzzle we&rsquo;ve inherited more often....

                        You need to develop a broad spectrum of style and then be able to move from one end of the spectrum to the other as occasion demands. You&rsquo;ll develop a basic style but inability to diversify is being like a baller with a drive but no jump shot. Questions to ask: What am I writing about? Who will read what I&rsquo;ve written? Why did I write it?   I&rsquo;m writing about topics that I want to know more about....

                        Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.

                        10,000 Hours, YMMV  10,000 hours introduced here  
  10,000 hours has been lauded by popular authors, e.g. Malcolm Gladwel&rsquo;s Outliers, and Geoff Colvin&rsquo;s Talent is Overrated. Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &ldquo;10,000 hours rule&rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts. 
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.
A cross-sectional study is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population (or a representative subset) at a specific point in time....
