  Terms like &ldquo;medical-grade&rdquo;, &ldquo;military-grade&rdquo; and &ldquo;organic&rdquo; often make consumers over-estimate the products' good qualities. Sometimes the test itself is too easy to pass.
For instance, &ldquo;military-grade&rdquo; comes from specs by the military to enable interchangeability between manufacturers. Saying something is military-grade without quoting some mil-spec, e.g. shock tests, is bogus. [] []
Costco Kirkland is more likely to be high quality because Costco demands it from the supplier....

                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. []

                        How Does Wall Street Make Its Money? Big banks are in the business of providing liquidity, and can therefore make money during crises. While asset prices typically goes down, the price of liquidity does not. []

                        Retained Mode vs. Immediate Mode In retained mode, the graphics library exposes an API to the application for building/updating a scene. However, the graphics library is in charge of issuing drawing commands. In contrast, an immediate-mode API allows the application to issue the drawing commands. Retained-mode APIs abstract away initialization, state maintenance and cleanup, but uses more memory. Immediate-mode APIs allow for more targeted optimizations. []

                        Faster Human Trials In 1986, AZT (AIDS treatment) showed 1/145 deaths compared to the placebo&rsquo;s 16/137. 6,000 AIDS patients were offered AZT, helping it get to the public much faster. []
Different rules apply in a pandemic. If the treatment is sufficiently promising, we should skip to human clinical trials. Covid-19 has a lower fatality rate than AIDS, which set a precedent. 3,000 altruists have even offered to deliberately expose themselves to covid-19!...

                        20 years later, JetBrains is valued at $7b without taking VC money. HN users praise JetBrains for being user-focused, and the prevailing argument is that VC money comes with growth-hacking attached. []

                        To classify something, find things that are similar and label it with the same class as the most similar thing.
The feature space is \(N-d\), where \(N\) is the number of features. Each instance is mapped to a point. The descriptive features become the axes.
The Similarity Metric Mathematically, it must conform to these 4 criteria:
 Non-negative: \(f(a, b) \ge 0\) Identity: \( f(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b \) Symmetry: \( f(a, b) = f(b, a) \) Triangular inequality: \( f(a, b) \le f(a, c) + f(c, b) \)  Why are non-negativity and triangular inequality important?...

                        Startups vs. Incumbents  Why Do Competitive Edges Die?
 Having a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially ones that conflict with your chosen [successful] strategy. Additionally, having to maintain/exceed quarterly numbers dissuade incumbents from risk taking. []

                        Consultants are not well suited for strategy (you probably have a deeper understanding). They are also an expensive way of proving your point to management. However, they are good for emergency horsepower, e.g. data analysis, and for primary research within your industry (they probably have a broader understanding). []
