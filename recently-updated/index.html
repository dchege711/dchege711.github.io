                        The Importance of Clear Writing In science, tech, or management, you influence people by writing things for them to read. 
An essay helps you figure something out. Think of it as an idea graph - at each node, pick the most interesting related idea. Expressing your ideas also helps you form them. Writing them down forces you to think well. 
I&rsquo;ve noticed this when composing a post to ask why my code is not working....

                        Planning: Deciding What and How to Write If you can&rsquo;t envision the audience, think, &ldquo;If someone had needed to give you this info 6 months ago, how should they have done it?&rdquo; 
Each section (and sub-section, recursively) should have its purpose. 
How is the purpose defined? Maybe each question should be an answer to an implicit question.
  If stuck on ordering, first write down ideas in random order, and then sort them....

                        While Connectors connect us with new people, Mavens connect us with information.
Mavens notice the details, e.g. connecting Brazilian frost to coffee prices and stockpiling in anticipation, noticing when a supermarket slaps an &ldquo;everyday low price!&rdquo; without actually lowering the price, etc.
A Connector might tell 10 friends where to stay in LA and 5 might take his advice. A Maven might tell 5 people where to stay in LA but make the case so emphatically that all 5 would take the advice....

When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.
The Flat Earthers Earth&rsquo;s curvature is nearly 0....

                        Data Science: Reality Doesn&rsquo;t Meet Expectations  Execs frequently ignore data science research when making decisions.
Data is often dirty, or insufficient to make decisions about majority of the users. Sometimes the infrastructure is poor - SQL queries take hours.
Data Scientists are usually the only &lsquo;data person&rsquo; on the team. Tons of request from teams, and most of the work is repetitive and &lsquo;easy&rsquo;.
Measuring impact is hard - especially on dollars that were hypothetically saved but never spent....

                        Looking for parallels should be done cautiously. For example, the advantaging associated with race may be different from the one associated with heterosexism. It&rsquo;s also hard to disentangle [dis]advantaging where social class, economic class, race, religion, sexuality, ethnic identity, and other factors interact. 
Isn&rsquo;t this the crux of intersectionality studies?
Intersectionality identifies multiple factors of advantage and disadvantage. Factors include gender, caste, sex, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, religion, disability, weight, and physical appearance....
