                        Formal Software Design Alloy is an open-source language and analyzer for software modeling. An Alloy model is a collection of constraints that describe a set of structures, e.g. all possible security configurations of a web application. Alloy&rsquo;s tool, the Alloy Analyzer is a solver that takes the constraints of a model and finds structures that satisfy them. 
ðŸ“‘    The Alloy Analyzer leverages a SAT solver, and this precludes Alloy from analyzing optimization problems....

                        Dependency Management Golang introduced a new library referencing mode to overcome limitations of the old one. While the two library modes are supported by Golang, they are incompatible, e.g. dependency management (DM) issues, reference inconsistencies, build failures, etc.  did an empirical study that resulted in HERO, an automated technique to detect DM issues and suggest fixes. Applied to 19k Golang projects, HERO detected 98.5% on a DM issue benchmark, and found 2,422 new DM issues in 2,356 Golang projects....

                        Random walk: future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. Thus, short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable.
Investing as a Way of Life Today Difference between speculations and investments: time period and predictability of the return.
To stay even, your returns must match inflation (averaged 4% from 1962 to 2018).
With regard to beating inflation, that implies all the money that&rsquo;s in people&rsquo;s bank accounts is depreciating, as opposed to maintaining value....

                        Motivation In 08. A New Walking Shoe: Modern Portfolio Theory   , Malkiel introduced me to Modern Portfolio Theory, a technique for reducing portfolio risk, despite risky investments. It made me wonder how similar principles are applied in agriculture. This page is the result of that investigation.
~16% of Kenya&rsquo;s land is sufficiently fertile and has good rainfall. In 2006, ~75% of working Kenyans are farmers (compared to 80% in 1980)....

PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come....

                        Method of Definition: Prototype Semantics There is a cognitive science view of categorization that says:
 Category members need not necessarily share a single set of distinguishing features, and may exhibit features to greater/lesser degrees Some category members are more typical than others  This reasoning goes against how I mentally picture a category.
  Although lies may have identifiable features such as misrepresentation of belief, intent to deceive, falseness and reprehensible motives, not all features are always present, and not all features are equally prominent in every instance....

                        How Doctors Die.  Ken Murray. www.zocalopublicsquare.org  . Nov 30, 2011.   Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &lsquo;do everything&rsquo;, but often they mean &lsquo;do everything thatâ€™s reasonable.&rsquo; But they may not know whatâ€™s reasonable....

LTCM were exploiting market inefficiencies. Other people learned of the tricks. LTCM didn&rsquo;t lose hope. They borrowed more and more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins.
And their math probably said the leverage was okay....

                        Life is Short.  Paul Graham. www.paulgraham.com  . Jan 1, 2016.   Some of it is our own fault (e.g. arguing online). Some of it is forced by circumstances that we choose to endure (e.g. unnecessary meetings at work)
Choosing a bullshit minimizing path is error-prone. Your priorities change over time. Periodically evaluate where you are. It helps to have measurable aspects of your life.
