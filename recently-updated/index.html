                        Bloom Filters In true fashion to Stigler&rsquo;s Law of Eponymy (no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer ), Ross Ashby (1960) did a probabilistic analysis of Calvin Mooers&rsquo;s Zatocoding (1947) (coding system for library cards). This predates Burton Bloom&rsquo;s work (1970). 
  Motivation A Bloom filter for a set \(X: \{x_1, x_2, &hellip;, x_n\} \) from some universe \(\mathbb{U}\) allows one to test whether a given item \(x \in \mathbb{B}\) is an element of \(X\)....

                        Method of Definition: Prototype Semantics There is a cognitive science view of categorization that says:
 Category members need not necessarily share a single set of distinguishing features, and may exhibit features to greater/lesser degrees Some category members are more typical than others  This reasoning goes against how I mentally picture a category.
  Although lies may have identifiable features such as misrepresentation of belief, intent to deceive, falseness and reprehensible motives, not all features are always present, and not all features are equally prominent in every instance....

                        Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.

Notably, Ericsson has dismissed the &ldquo;10,000 hours rule&rdquo; as misconstruing his positions: genetics play a role; 10,000-hours of deliberate practice is not all that counts. 
Most data in support of the 10,000-hours rule has been cross-sectional and retrospective.

                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene.
