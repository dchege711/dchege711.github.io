Keeping the exchange rate fixed requires governments to nudge the rate, e.g.
 Use reserves of foreign currency to buy up their own currency Set high interest rates to entice lenders to buy their currency  Margaret Thatcher (PM) opposed the fixed exchange rates but lost the vote to Major, an ERM proponent....

Admittedly, these are things that the government should be doing, but it seems that the government doesn&rsquo;t do enough. Furthermore, some of these issues so politicized, e.g. immigrants, that government support can be fickle.
  Foundations are more effective than governments as they do their due diligence, e....

                        Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &ldquo;Life After Hate&rdquo; suggested to them. 
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?...

                        What determines the returns from stocks and bonds? A stock buyer expects a growing stream of dividends. If the company re-invests its profits, the stock buyer expects more rapidly growing dividends in the future, or a lucrative stock buyback.
Long-run Equity Return = Initial Dividend Yield + Growth Rate
In the short run (e.g. a year) the changes in price/dividend or price/earnings multiples determine returns. In optimistic times, e.g. March 2000, P/E &gt; 30 and P/D &gt; 80....
