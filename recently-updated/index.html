Git&rsquo;s interface is a leaky abstraction. While the interface is at times ugly, its underlying design and ideas are beautiful. A bottom-up explanation of Git therefore makes more sense.

                        Topic 2: Shell Tools.  MIT Computer Science. https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/ .  Unlike other scripting programming languages, shell scripting is optimized for shell related tasks, e.g. reading from STDIN and saving results into files are primitives.
At the cost of being painful on the eyes. Python scripts are way more readable (and cross-platform) than shell scripts.

                        Classifying mathematics by its subject matter may be misleading because the kinds of questions being asked may be the same, despite different subject matter.
Nonetheless, classifying by subject matter, we crudely have algebra, geometry and analysis.
Algebra vs. Geometry It&rsquo;s insufficient to claim that algebra contains symbols, while arithmetic contains numbers. In advanced mathematics, numbers rarely appear without letters.
Manipulating symbols through rules, e.g. do the same to both sides, is thought of as algebra....

                        Return the Average Value One possible solution is to return the average value in the neighborhood, i.e.
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i $$
We can improve this by using weighted \(k-NN\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} \cdot t_i \right) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} } $$
The formula looks new. However, if \(x_1\) is weighted by \(w_1\) and \(x_2\) by \(w_2\), then the weighted average is:
$$ \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 }{w_1 + w_2} $$...
