                        On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way. 
 is straw-manning though. It&rsquo;s less of a sunk cost fallacy, and more of a Chesterton&rsquo;s Fence situation: Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place....

                        Why Write Tests Helps catch bugs in the code, and in the programmer&rsquo;s mental model of what the code does. 
  The later a bug is caught in the development cycle, the more expensive it is to fix it. A good test today is a future debugging session saved. 
The test is the first client of your code. It uncovers sub-optimal design choices, tight couplings, missed cases, etc....

                        Issues #18 to #23 didn&rsquo;t have moments that made me think/pause. Mostly free-flowing; similar to how Monstress is turning out. Maybe the series is tapering out? Or the novelty has faded. All the more impressive that Sandman kept me hooked through +70 issues. Will give it one more shot by reading Book 3 (#24 - #36).

                        &ldquo;Monstress&rdquo; by Marjorie Liu. Credits: imagecomics.com
  Ms. Liu notes   that Monstress is a creator-owned comic book series. Why is &ldquo;creator-owned&rdquo; significant?
While creator ownership has been common in fiction writing, it&rsquo;s more the exception in comics, recorded music, and motion pictures, where the work is sold to the publishers, or produced as work-for-hire. Prominent outfits for creator-owned comics include Image Comics (founded by prominent Marvel artists), DC&rsquo;s Vertigo imprint (now Black Label), and Dark Horse Comics' Legend imprint....

                        The Importance of Clear Writing In science, tech, or management, you influence people by writing things for them to read. 
An essay helps you figure something out. Think of it as an idea graph - at each node, pick the most interesting related idea. Expressing your ideas also helps you form them. Writing them down forces you to think well. 
I&rsquo;ve noticed this when composing a post to ask why my code is not working....

Each section (and sub-section, recursively) should have its purpose. 
How is the purpose defined? Maybe each question should be an answer to an implicit question.

Mavens notice the details, e.g. connecting Brazilian frost to coffee prices and stockpiling in anticipation, noticing when a supermarket slaps an &ldquo;everyday low price!&rdquo; without actually lowering the price, etc.
A Connector might tell 10 friends where to stay in LA and 5 might take his advice. A Maven might tell 5 people where to stay in LA but make the case so emphatically that all 5 would take the advice....

                        Looking for parallels should be done cautiously. For example, the advantaging associated with race may be different from the one associated with heterosexism. It&rsquo;s also hard to disentangle [dis]advantaging where social class, economic class, race, religion, sexuality, ethnic identity, and other factors interact. 
Isn&rsquo;t this the crux of intersectionality studies?
Intersectionality identifies multiple factors of advantage and disadvantage. Factors include gender, caste, sex, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, religion, disability, weight, and physical appearance....
