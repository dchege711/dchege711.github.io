                        Project Dragonfly  A censored version of Google search that blacklists websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion and peaceful protests.
China has 750m people; 80% of its internet access is on Android. There&rsquo;s $$$ to be made.
Between 2006 and 2010, Google had maintained a censored Google Search, but was heavily criticized.
Google Search was then uncensored because of &ldquo;Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites and hack Google computer systems&rdquo;...

                        Medical care is like the opposite of moving fast and breaking things. If it&rsquo;s so taboo to admit error, then that could make errors more common because fewer people are learning from past errors.
  Norms for Scientific Activity and the Sources of Error &ldquo;Science&rdquo; is taken to mean &ldquo;Natural Science&rdquo;.
  Internal norms derive from a cognitive pursuit of science. They are:
 Focus on the central rather than the peripheral problems of the science in in question....

                        Pagination with Relative Cursors  Exposing pagination through URLs like example.com/items?page=25&amp;limit=100 leads to SQL like SELECT * from 'items' LIMIT 100 OFFSET 2400;, which inefficiently goes through 2,500 records and discards the first 2,400.
With relative cursors, we have URLs like example.com/items?limit=50&amp;lastID=XXX, which leads to SQL like SELECT * from 'items' WHERE 'id' &gt; XXX ORDER BY 'id' ASC LIMIT 50, and this is more efficient, assuming there are indexes for id....

                        The Tulip Bulb Craze Virus causes colored stripes in tulip petals. The Dutch valued such bulbs. Prices rose (just when one thought they couldn&rsquo;t go higher). Let the tulipmania begin.
Note: And that&rsquo;s where FOMO comes in. You can&rsquo;t argue with the results. You just want to dip your toes and get out. I watched Bitcoin keep climbing, until I got into the game with $50&hellip;

                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. 
The Accuracy of DNA Testing is Wanting  74/108 crime labs erroneously incriminated a suspect during a mock study....

                        Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &ldquo;Life After Hate&rdquo; suggested to them. 
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?...

                        But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in intensified form. The language becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easy for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible.
Standard phrases already have rhythm. They are a convenient shortcut for lazy communicators.
Pretentious diction to make the banal appear profound, the biased seem scientifically impartial and sordid events masquerade as dignified....

The crows found the desired stems even when they had been disguised with leaves from a different plant species.
There are anecdotes of crow intelligence too, e.g. using cars at a crosslight to crush cashews in Japan (more in this HN thread  )...

                        Return the Average Value One possible solution is to return the average value in the neighborhood, i.e.
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i $$
We can improve this by using weighted \(k-NN\):
$$ \mathbb{M}_{k}(q) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} \cdot t_i \right) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{dist(q, d_i)^2} } $$
The formula looks new. However, if \(x_1\) is weighted by \(w_1\) and \(x_2\) by \(w_2\), then the weighted average is:
$$ \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 }{w_1 + w_2} $$...

                        When you have features taking different range if values, you may have odd predictions.
For example, if \(f_1 \in [0, 100]\) and \(f_2 \in [0, 1]\), \(f_1\) will always be penalized more than \(f_2\) when computing the distance.
  To mitigate this, normalize the feature&rsquo;s ranges to \([r_{low}, r_{high}]\):
$$ a'_i = \frac{a_i - a_{min}}{ a_{max} - a_{min}} \cdot (r_{high} - r_{low}) + r_{low} $$
Typically, the range is normalized to \([r_{low}, r_{high}] = [0, 1]\), so range normalization simplifies to:...

                        Similarity-based learning is intuitive and gives people confidence in the model.
There is an inductive bias that instances that have similar descriptive features belong to the same class.
Remarkably so. When I think of classifying things, my mind immediately goes to NN.
  Similarity learning has a stationary assumption, i.e. the joint PDF of the data doesn&rsquo;t change (new classifications do not come up). This assumption is shared by supervised ML....
