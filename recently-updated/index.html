                        Imaginative literature primarily pleases rather than teaches. It is much easier to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know why one is pleased. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth.

                        Unknown Number  tells the story of a person who has gender dysphoria. In an alternate universe, they never transitioned but went on to become an established physicist who could communicate across parallel universes.
The use of text message screenshots (and corresponding alternative text) brings a modern feel to the piece.

  Ms. Liu notes   that Monstress is a creator-owned comic book series. Why is &ldquo;creator-owned&rdquo; significant?
While creator ownership has been common in fiction writing, it&rsquo;s more the exception in comics, recorded music, and motion pictures, where the work is sold to the publishers, or produced as work-for-hire. Prominent outfits for creator-owned comics include Image Comics (founded by prominent Marvel artists), DC&rsquo;s Vertigo imprint (now Black Label), and Dark Horse Comics' Legend imprint....

                        Reaction Times are Overrated Elite athletes do not display superior reaction times to those of average people; most hover at 200ms.
However, games are played at speeds where 200ms is too slow, e.g. 100-mph baseballs, 130-mph tennis serves, etc.
A reaction time of less than 100ms is deemed a false start in track and field sprints.

                        Is Dentistry a Science?  Ferris Jabr. www.theatlantic.com  . May 1, 2019.    Cochrane Oral Health   reviews dental procedures in a systematic manner. Unfortunately, most of the reviews don&rsquo;t find substantive support for dental interventions.
There is currently no substantive evidence for: binannual cleanings, fluoridation reducing tooth decay in adults; regular flossing combating plaque (gum disease? probably); preventative wisdom teeth removal; tooth-colored resin instead of metal amalgam fillings; crown vs....

The crows found the desired stems even when they had been disguised with leaves from a different plant species.

This was the problem. The number of API calls should be dependent on the stops themselves, not the buses. For an MVP, sure - make that query - but if you&rsquo;re running a growing business, those calls add up!...

                        Environmentalism Over the last 70 years, less than 10% of plastic waste has been recycled - it&rsquo;s uneconomical. Recycling shifts attention from the environmental impact of plastics and their overproduction to the consumer&rsquo;s willingness to recycle. Reducing and reusing is a much better environmental strategy.

The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of Engineers.
