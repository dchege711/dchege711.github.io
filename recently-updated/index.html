I think for the general population, the value of privacy is not worth the inconvenience associated with securing it, in the cases where it&rsquo;s not readily availed by Big Tech.

People&rsquo;s uncertainty about the consequences of privacy-related behaviors and their own preferences over those consequences Incomplete and asymmetric information. People rarely know what info others, firms and govts have about them or how the info is used.

                        Techno-utopianism claimed that the old ways of doing things are broken, and technology is the panacea: ending poverty, fixing racism, equalizing opportunity, strengthening democracy; toppling authoritarian regimes.
Disruptive, wealthy and apolitical innovators were/are the heroes, and not the tech activists, e.g. the late Aaron Swartz.
However, the conversation has shifted to techno-dystopianism: humans losing jobs, loss of privacy, radicalization, etc.
But both techno-utopianism and techno-dystopianism are too facile and simplistic outlooks....

Given multiple base stations, the angle and time of arrival, and location signatures of each cell location can be used to locate a mobile device. The higher the density of cell towers, the more precise the calculated location....

Notable Plot Points Prodded by Haber to dream of the end of overpopulation, Orr dreamt of a plague that killed 6B people. But Orr tries to convince himself that the world that was was fiction in his head, so he didn&rsquo;t really kill anyone....

                        Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &ldquo;Life After Hate&rdquo; suggested to them.

                        From my vantage point, it seems there are two camps. But reality is often a shade of grey. Interested in various arguments that frequently arise in this area. I have my opinions/biases, but nothing that I can defend rigorously.
Some (most?) of these claims are supported by anecdotal evidence, which is an avenue for belief fixation, and therefore makes it hard to come to a resolution  .
I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because anti-PC material is more viral, but most of the prominent publications are either anti-PC, or anti-anti-PC....

Let’s tell representatives what their constituents think. Then they HAVE to vote with us!

                        The human genome has sequences of nucleotide base pairs that are repeated over and over again. At each locus of interest, a person has two sets of repeats inherited from each parent. Each possible difference at a locus is an allele. The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene.

 Category members need not necessarily share a single set of distinguishing features, and may exhibit features to greater/lesser degrees Some category members are more typical than others  This reasoning goes against how I mentally picture a category.
  Although lies may have identifiable features such as misrepresentation of belief, intent to deceive, falseness and reprehensible motives, not all features are always present, and not all features are equally prominent in every instance....
