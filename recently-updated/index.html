  At the very least, Chrome is worth studying. Something worked out. I&rsquo;m biased, I only plan to deeply explore Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
  Stability, Testing and the Multi-Process Architecture  In a single-threaded browser, devs use asynchronous APIs - which may sometimes hold the browser up. Instead of multiple threads, Chromium chose multiple processes: isolation, independent crashes, better asymptotic memory management, identifying expensive sites, etc....

                        WWW &lsquo;21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021 User-oriented Fairness in Recommendation  Showed that active users who only account for a small proportion enjoy much higher recommendation quality than the majority inactive users. They propose a re-ranking approach by adding constraints over the evaluation metrics.
There&rsquo;s a subtlety here. Although the active users are the minority, the recommender considers them the majority as they are the ones providing a lot of the training data....

                        The paper is written in a period when NLP practitioners are producing bigger (# of parameters; size of training data) language models (LMs), and pushing the top scores on benchmarks.

Marginalized communities are doubly punished. They are least likely to benefit from LMs, e....

                        The Tulip Bulb Craze Virus causes colored stripes in tulip petals. The Dutch valued such bulbs. Prices rose (just when one thought they couldn&rsquo;t go higher). Let the tulipmania begin.
Note: And that&rsquo;s where FOMO comes in. You can&rsquo;t argue with the results. You just want to dip your toes and get out. I watched Bitcoin keep climbing, until I got into the game with $50&hellip;

                        Pre-read thoughts.
I think for the general population, the value of privacy is not worth the inconvenience associated with securing it, in the cases where it&rsquo;s not readily availed by Big Tech. For example, one wouldn&rsquo;t go out of their way to not have passwords and 2FA. However, when it comes to matters like online privacy, most folks are willing to allow surveillance in exchange for free services like web search, social media, etc....

                        Techno-utopianism claimed that the old ways of doing things are broken, and technology is the panacea: ending poverty, fixing racism, equalizing opportunity, strengthening democracy; toppling authoritarian regimes.
Disruptive, wealthy and apolitical innovators were/are the heroes, and not the tech activists, e.g. the late Aaron Swartz.
However, the conversation has shifted to techno-dystopianism: humans losing jobs, loss of privacy, radicalization, etc.
