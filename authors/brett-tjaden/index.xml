      <description>The Midnight Ride [] Afternoon of April 18, 1775: Paul Revere, a silversmith, got word of British planning to raise hell the next day.
Revere goes out informing people. Churchbells and drums. Those informed by Revere send out riders of their own.
In Concord, the colonial militia soundly beat the British, kicking off the American Revolution.
Wiliam Dawes also had a ride. But the local militia leaders weren&amp;rsquo;t alerted. Few people came out to fight the British.</description>
