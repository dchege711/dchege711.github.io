      <description>Ambiguity Equivocation How can you be against faith when you take leaps of faith all the time: making investments, trusting friends, and even getting engaged?
No True Scotsman &amp;ldquo;But John is a programmer, and he is not socially awkward at all.&amp;rdquo; Yes, but John isn’t a true programmer.
Causal Not a Cause for a Cause The hacker took down the railway company’s website, and when I checked the train schedule, what do you know, they were all delayed!</description>

      <description>Argument from Consequences If God does not exist, then everything is permitted.
Straw Man The essence of this technique is to caricature a position to make it easier to attack. 
My opponent is trying to convince you that we evolved from chimpanzees who were swinging from trees, a truly ludicrous claim. 
Environmentalists care more for snail darters and spotted owls than they do for people. 
Appeal to Fear You should give me all your valuables before the police get here.</description>

      <description>Unfalsifiable but favorable propositions invite baloney. For example, one might want to believe in life after death, without being interested in evidence for it. However, one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t validate the pretensions of mediums on such a belief.
 The LeftOvers (TV Series)   explores this a bit. John pretends to be a medium, but actually has a hidden mic and earpiece to Laurie, who then searches the internet for details on the person of interest.</description>
