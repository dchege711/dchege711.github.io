      <description>How to Get Startup Ideas  Err on the side of having competitors, but make sure that you have a thesis that everyone else is overlooking, e.g. Google wasn&amp;rsquo;t averse to users leaving google.com ASAP.
The Startup Idea Matrix, ( B2B Edition   , B2C Edition   ) is a good start for knowing who to google.
  Big companies tend to be slow at changing their approach.</description>

      <description>On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs  Capitalism is meant to eliminate bullshit jobs, yet layoffs tend to fall on people making, moving, fixing and maintaining things, but not on the salaried paper pushers that effectively work 15 hours a week.
â€‹From a political standpoint, a happy productive population with free time on their hands is mortal to the ruling class. Moreover, work is considered a moral value in itself.</description>

      <description>On &amp;ldquo;Doing Your Research&amp;rdquo; Of late, the phrase &amp;ldquo;do your research&amp;rdquo; has been popular , with some pushing back claiming that lay people tend to entrench their initial opinions and should defer to the consensus of scientific experts . How does one spot the scientific consensus?
Maybe by surveying the publications   of the relevant field. Indexing and abstracting services provide abstracts of publications and references to documents , and may thus prove useful.</description>

      <description>Life is Short.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html  . Jan 1, 2016.   Some of it is our own fault (e.g. arguing online). Some of it is forced by circumstances that we choose to endure (e.g. unnecessary meetings at work)
Choosing a bullshit minimizing path is error-prone. Your priorities change over time. Periodically evaluate where you are. It helps to have measurable aspects of your life.</description>

      <description>The Submarine.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html  . Apr 1, 2005.   Many people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come.</description>
