      <description>Snow, Glass, Apples Stumbled onto  from Hoopla&amp;rsquo;s recommendations.  flips the script and tells the story from the step mother&amp;rsquo;s perspective, and she is also the protagonist.
  Snow White is a vampire. She fed on her father (consensually?), the King, to the point of him being a shadow of a man. Her stepmother, the Queen, was only 18 when the King died. The Queen had witnessed Snow White&amp;rsquo;s vampirism, and so she had a servant kill her by carving out her heart and dump her in the forest.</description>

  Path to comic: Lucifer (Netflix) -&amp;gt; Lucifer (Comic) -&amp;gt; The Sandman (Comic)
Netflix is also adapting the comic, so interested in how it deviates from the source. Ser Brienne of Tarth will be Lucifer. Hype!

  Mark Evanier: Can you prove that ancient civilizations weren&amp;rsquo;t visited by space travellers and heralded as gods? Did those aliens alight on this planet eons ago and plant the seeds of our civilization?
The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of Engineers.
  Jack Kirby, 1976: I feel that playing around with this sort of conjecture is highly entertaining, and that we should aim our gunsights at this giant puzzle we&amp;rsquo;ve inherited more often.</description>
