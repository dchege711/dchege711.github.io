      <description>From my vantage point, it seems there are two camps. But reality is often a shade of grey. Interested in various arguments that frequently arise in this area. I have my opinions/biases, but nothing that I can defend rigorously.
Some (most?) of these claims are supported by anecdotal evidence, which is an avenue for belief fixation, and therefore makes it hard to come to a resolution  .
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because anti-PC material is more viral, but most of the prominent publications are either anti-PC, or anti-anti-PC.</description>
