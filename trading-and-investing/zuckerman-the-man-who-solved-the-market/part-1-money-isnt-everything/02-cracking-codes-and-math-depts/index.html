            <h2 id="cracking-codes-and-problems-at-the-ida">Cracking Codes and Problems at the IDA</h2>
<p>At IDA, Simons developed a fast code-breaking algorithm for a long-standing problem. However, because this work was confidential, he couldn&rsquo;t share accomplishments with outsiders.</p>
<p>A soap film stretching across a wire frame has minimal area. Plateau&rsquo;s Problem: Do such minimal areas always exist and are they always so smooth no matter the wireframe? In 1930, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; was proved for 2-D. Almgren, PU Prof, proved it for 3-D. Simons extended this to 6-D and formed a counter-example in 7-D.</p>
<p>Simons and Crew relied on a hidden Markov model theory. The market has (8) underlying states, e.g. &ldquo;high variance&rdquo;, &ldquo;good&rdquo;, etc. By determining the most likely states, one could make appropriate bets - the &lsquo;why&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Other notables that were trying to solve the market: Harry Markowitz (Modern Portfolio Theory), Edward Thorp.</p>
<h2 id="simons-at-suny-stony-brooks-math-department">Simons at SUNY Stony Brook&rsquo;s Math Department</h2>
<p>The Vietnam War put criticism on the IDA. Simons publicly disavowed the war. He was let go. Opportunely, SUNY Stony Brook had spent 5 years looking for someone to revitalize its Math Dept. Simons was recommended to the College President, and accepted the job. There, he honed a skill for recruiting talented math minds.</p>

<p>Barbara felt stunted - she had married at 18 and had a kid at 19. They divorced. She went to UCB, completed CS PhD, did research at IBM, headed ACM and became a national expert on computerized voting.</p>
<p>Simons contributed to quantifying shapes in curved 3D spaces. Chern extended it to all dimensions. The Chern-Simons theory won accolades and found applications in condensed matter, string theory and supergravity.</p>

<h2 id="the-allure-of-the-trading-world">The Allure of the Trading World</h2>
<p>Freifeld built econometrics models to forecast commodity prices. Although they made money, Mayer remarked that there was no socially redeeming value in it.</p>
<p>In 1977, world currencies had begun to float (no longer pegged to the price of gold). Recognizing the volatile era, Simons eventually left academia to focus on currency trading.</p>
<p>At IDA, Simons built models to spot signals in the noise of comms of US enemies. At Stony Brook, he courted and managed talented mathematicians. Now, he&rsquo;d hire their brains to develop formulas to profit from market data.</p>
