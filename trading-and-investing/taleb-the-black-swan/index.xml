      <description>The problem of induction: a turkey cannot possibly predict what happens on the afternoon before Thanksgiving.
But if we observe all turkeys in the US, won&#39;t we notice that they&#39;re more likely to die right before Thanksgiving? Zooming out to the bigger picture invalidates Taleb&#39;s point.
  Statements presented as science may not be as rigorous as they seem. Finding confirmation is easy.
We are suckers for narratives. Hindsight attributes causality where none was apparent, e.</description>

      <description>Mediocristan vs Extremistan: In Extremistan, one single observation can disproportionately affect the outcome.
If finance were Gaussian, then the 2008 crash (more than 20 std) would take place every several billion lifetimes of the universe. In the last 50 years, the 10 most extreme days in finance markets represent half the returns.
Taleb comments that people like Gaussian tools because they give numbers, and that &amp;ldquo;something is better than nothing&amp;rdquo;. If that something is mostly wrong, would one rather have nothing?</description>
