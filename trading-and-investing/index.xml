      <description>Kobayashi Maru.  Epsilon Theory. https://www.epsilontheory.com/kobayashi-maru/. Jan 29, 2019.  Environmental, Social and Governance Investing. So general as to be meaningless: marketing BS (thinking &amp;lsquo;holistically&amp;rsquo; about ESG risk factors as part of the investment process) to impact investing (providing wholesale financing for community lending initiatives).
ESG! The meme is about selling portfolios as virtue signaling devices. It moves the conversation away from fees and performance to values. Don&#39;t you want to make a difference?</description>

Sears bet the Internet changed nothing. Beenz bet the Internet changed everything - creating a points-based currency valid only at online merchants. Amazon bet the Internet changed distribution, but rooted its strategy in selection and low prices.</description>

Jun 17, 2016.  Before the EU, Europe had the ERM to fix their exchange rates with the Deutschmark within 6% of the agreed upon rate.
