state-setting ops `subject` call `notify`, \n might several consecutive ops cause several consecutive updates, \n may inefficient. clients responsible, errors likely since \n clients might forget it. \n \n ### avoiding dangling references \n \n deleting subject produce dangling references observers. one \n solution subject notify observers deleted, \n observers reset reference it. deleting observers \n solution observers might referenced elsewhere, e.g. listening \n subjects. \n \n {{% open-comment %}} \n chromium opt `scopedobservation` \n `scopedmultisourceobservation` expose subject(s)? {{% cite \n chromiumscopedobservation %}} {{% cite chromiumscopedmultisourceobservation %}} \n {{% /open-comment %}} \n \n ### maintaining consistency `subject` \n \n also need ensure subject self-consistent notification. \n example, code buggy: \n \n ```cpp \n void mysubject::operation(int new_value) { \n baseclasssubject::operation(new_value); \n // trigger notification. \n my_internal_value_ += new_value; \n // update subclass state (too late!) \n } \n ``` \n \n one solution send notifications template methods abstract \n `subject` class, e.g. \n \n ```cpp \n void text::cut(textrange r) { \n replacerange(r); // redefined subclasses. \n notify(); \n } \n ``` \n \n ### specificity/efficiency `update` protocols \n \n there\'s tradeoff specificity `update` protocols. push model, \n subject sends detailed information change, pull \n model, subject sends minimal notification, observers \n must explicitly ask details. push model makes observers less re-usable, \n pull method may inefficient. \n \n allowing observers register specific events interest improve \n update efficiency. api like one possible solution: \n \n ```cpp \n void subject::attach(observer*, aspect& interest); \n \n void observer::update(subject*, aspect& interest); \n ``` \n \n {{% comment %}} \n step could `subject` sending notifications observers \n interested `aspect` affected subject\'s \n state change. \n \n alternatively, common pattern see chromium subclassing base \n `observer` interface, providing specific apis, e.g. \n `clocktimerobserver::onhourchanged(clocktimer* timer, int new_hour)`. \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n cases, updates may inundate observer, e.g. subject\'s \n changing state several times second. observer may incorporate timer \n represent approximate state model regular interval. {{% cite \n wikiobserverpattern %}} \n \n ### orchestrating complex relationships subjects observers \n \n dependency relationships subjects observers may complex, e.g. \n operation involves changes several interdependent subjects, \n need ensure observers notified subjects \n modified, `changemanager` useful: \n \n ```cpp \n void subject::notify() { \n change_manager_->notify(); \n } \n \n class changemanager { \n public: \n register(subject*, observer*); \n unregister(subject* observer*); \n notify(); \n } \n \n void changemanager::notify() { \n // naive implementation sends notifications observers. \n (subject* : subjects_) { \n (observer* : s->observers) { \n o->update(s); \n } \n } \n } \n ``` \n \n `changemanager::notify` smarter, e.g. maintaining dag \n `observer* o` observes multiple subjects, `o->update(s)` \n called avoid redundant updates. \n \n {{% comment %}} \n `changemanager` instance `mediator` pattern. \n {{% /comment %}} \n \n ### combining `subject` `observer` interfaces class \n \n note languages, e.g. smalltalk, lack multiple inheritance (mi). \n cases, makes sense combine `observer` `subject` interface \n class. \n \n {{% comment %}} \n lack mi anomaly. c++ got mi hybrid (contains \n primitives objects) language enforce single monolithic class \n hierarchy, unlike smalltalk. \n \n mi\'s famous drawback diamond problem prominent con. \n example: `d` inherits `c` `b`, inherit `a`. \n `b` `c` override `a::foo`, `d` not; `d->foo()` called, \n `foo` gets called?
