# return code previous command \n $$ # process identification number current script \n !! # entire last command, including arguments. \n $_ # last argument last command. \n ``` \n \n ## command substitution \n \n whenever place `$( cmd )` execute `cmd`, get output command substitute place, e.g. \n \n ```zsh \n file $(ls) # shell calls `ls` iterates values \n ``` \n \n ## process substitution \n \n `<( cmd )` execute `cmd` place output temp file substitute `<()` file’s name, e.g. \n \n ```zsh \n # command show differences files dirs foo bar \n diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar) \n ``` \n \n useful commands expect values passed file instead stdin. \n \n ## comparison checks \n \n ```zsh \n [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; \n # ... \n ``` \n \n try use double brackets [[ ]] instead simple brackets [ ] chance making mistakes lower. \n \n however, double brackets portable sh. single brackets old way testing conditions. \n \n ## expanding strings \n \n ```zsh \n convert image.{png,jpg} # expand to... \n convert image.png image.jpg \n ``` \n \n ## shebang lines \n \n called terminal, scripts need written shell language. she=bang sufficient, e.g. python script: \n \n ```python \n #!/usr/bin/env python \n import sys \n arg reversed(sys.argv[1:]): \n print(arg) \n ``` \n \n writing shebang, use `env` command resolve wherever command lives system. every computer `python` living `#!/usr/local/bin/python`. \n \n ## differences shell functions scripts \n \n | shell functions | shell scripts | \n | ---- | --- | \n | language shell | need shebang | \n | loaded definition read | loaded every time they\'re executed | \n | executed current shell environment. modify environment variables, change directory, etc. | execute process. receive exported environment variables value. | \n \n programming language functions powerful construct achieve modularity, code reuse clarity shell code. often shell scripts include function definitions. \n \n ## finding files \n \n unix-like systems come `find`, recursively searches files matching criteria. \n \n `.` means start searching current directory. `?` `*` match one amount characters respectively. \n \n globstar, `**` matches files zero directories subdirectories. `**/` matches directories subdirectories. see [globs (mywiki.wooledge.org)](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob) information. \n \n ```zsh \n # find directories named src \n find . -name src -type \n # find python files folder named test path \n find . -path \'**/test/**/*.py\' -type f \n # find files modified last day \n find . -mtime -1 \n # find zip files size range 500k 10m \n find . -size +500k -size -10m -name \'*.tar.gz\' \n # find png files convert jpg \n find . -name \'*.png\' -exec convert {} {.}.jpg \\; \n ``` \n \n unlike `find` fresh search time, `locate` uses (daily) updated database. however, despite faster, `locate` indexed file name stale. \n \n time, interested file contents. `grep` friend. \n \n ## shell history \n \n tried pressing arrow 1,000 times terminal command? `ctrl + r` allows perform backwards search history! \n \n start command leading space won’t added shell history. forgot space, edit `~/.bash_history` `~/.zhistory` file. \n \n ## exercises \n \n ### rtfm `ls` \n \n read man ls write ls command lists files following manner \n \n * includes files, including hidden files \n * sizes listed human readable format (e.g. 454m instead 454279954) \n * files ordered recency \n * output colorized \n \n ### marco! polo! \n \n write bash functions `marco` `polo` following. whenever execute `marco` current working directory saved manner, execute `polo`, matter directory in, `polo` `cd` back directory executed `marco`. \n \n ease debugging write code file `marco.sh` (re)load definitions shell executing `source marco.sh`. \n \n ### 100 runs \n \n say command fails rarely. order debug need capture output time consuming get failure run. \n \n write bash script runs following script fails captures standard output error streams files prints everything end. bonus points also report many runs took script fail. \n \n ```zsh \n {{< readfile file="/content/computer-science/the-missing-cs-semester/exercises/02-shell-tools/buggy.sh" >}} \n ``` \n \n ### zip \n \n covered lecture `find`\'s `-exec` powerful performing operations files searching for. however, want something files, like creating zip file? seen far commands take input arguments `stdin`. piping commands, connecting `stdout` `stdin`, commands like `tar` take inputs arguments. bridge disconnect there’s `xargs` command execute command using `stdin` arguments. example `ls | xargs rm` delete files current directory. \n \n task write command recursively finds html files folder makes zip them. note command work even files spaces (hint: check `-d` flag `xargs`) \n \n ### (advanced) tag, \n \n write command script recursively find recently modified file directory. generally, list files recency?
