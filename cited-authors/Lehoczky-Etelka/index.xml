  Ms. Liu notes   that Monstress is a creator-owned comic book series. Why is &amp;ldquo;creator-owned&amp;rdquo; significant?
While creator ownership has been common in fiction writing, it&amp;rsquo;s more the exception in comics, recorded music, and motion pictures, where the work is sold to the publishers, or produced as work-for-hire. Prominent outfits for creator-owned comics include Image Comics (founded by prominent Marvel artists), DC&amp;rsquo;s Vertigo imprint (now Black Label), and Dark Horse Comics&#39; Legend imprint.</description>
