      <description>Stories of Your Life and Others.  Ted Chiang. 2010. ISBN: 9781931520898 .   Tower of Babylon Story focused on Hillalum, who lived during the construction of the Tower of Babel .
 notes that the Hebrew school version was more elaborate than the Old Testament account, e.g. the tower is so tall that it takes a year to climb, and when a man falls to his death, no one mourns, but when a brick is dropped, the brick-layers weep because it will take a year to replace.</description>

When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.
The Flat Earthers Earth&amp;rsquo;s curvature is nearly 0.</description>
