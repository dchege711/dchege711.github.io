      <description>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering.  Brooks, Jr., Frederick P. Oct 1, 1974. ISBN: 0201006502 .   One of the striking differences is how Software Engineering (SWE) has evolved over time. Brook&amp;rsquo;s use of male-dominated language wasn&amp;rsquo;t an eyelid-batter during his time, but now, SWE tries to be more inclusive in its language. I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen content that uses &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; in hypothetical expositions.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also encountered practices in the workplace that may have been influenced by Mythical Man-Month.</description>

      <description>The Dilemma There are wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones. Sackman et. al. found 10:1 ratios. The data showed no correlation between experience and performance.
The idea of a 10x developer is mostly ridiculed in my online circles. That said, some jobs have X years of experience as a requirement. How can we resolve these contradictions?
  The major part of the cost of large teams is communication, and system debugging to correct the ill effects of miscommunication.</description>
