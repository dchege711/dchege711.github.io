Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 18, 2022. Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 02: Dive!</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/Dive/02-dive/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/Dive/02-dive/</guid><description>Day 2 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 19, 2022. Problem Statement Part One Now, you need to figure out how to pilot this thing.
It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like forward 1, down 2, or up 3:
forward X increases the horizontal position by X units. down X increases the depth by X units.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 03: Binary Diagnostic</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/BinaryDiagnostic/03-binary-diagnostic/</guid><description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 23, 2022. Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 04: Giant Squid</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/GiantSquid/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/GiantSquid/</guid><description>Day 4 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Feb 25, 2022. Part One You&amp;rsquo;re already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can&amp;rsquo;t see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
Maybe it wants to play bingo ?</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 06: Lanternfish</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/Lanternfish/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/Lanternfish/</guid><description>Day 6 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Mar 2, 2022. Part I Description The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?
A massive school of glowing lanternfish swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe exponentially quickly? You should model their growth to be sure.
Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 07: The Treachery of Whales</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/TreacheryOfWhales/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/TreacheryOfWhales/</guid><description>Day 7 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Mar 5, 2022. Part I Description A giant whale has decided that your submarine is its next meal, and it&amp;rsquo;s much faster than you are. There&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to run!
Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it&amp;rsquo;s too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they&amp;rsquo;re aiming!</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 08: Seven Segment Search</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</guid><description>Day 8 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Mar 7, 2022. Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 09: Smoke Basin</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SmokeBasin/</guid><description>Multi-dimensional arrays using &lt;code>massiv&lt;/code>; Fusion; Box vs. Unboxed; Connected Components; &lt;code>Data.Set&lt;/code>; Monadic map</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 10: Syntax Scoring</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SyntaxScoring/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SyntaxScoring/</guid><description>Day 10 - Advent of Code 2021. Eric Wastl. adventofcode.com . Accessed Apr 12, 2022. Part I You ask the submarine to determine the best route out of the deep-sea cave, but it only replies:
Syntax error in navigation subsystem on line: all of them The navigation subsystem is made of several lines containing chunks. There are one or more chunks on each line, and chunks contain zero or more other chunks.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2024 Day 04: Ceres Search</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2024/AoC2024/04-ceres-search/04-ceres-search/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2024/AoC2024/04-ceres-search/04-ceres-search/</guid><description>Problem This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words.
