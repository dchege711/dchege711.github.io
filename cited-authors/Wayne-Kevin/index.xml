A shortest-paths tree for a source \(s\) is a subgraph containing \(s\) and all the vertices reachable from \(s\) that forms a directed tree rooted at \(s\) such that every tree path is a shortest path in the digraph.</description></item><item><title>Bloom Filters</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/randomized-algs-and-ds/monte-carlo-algs-and-ds/bloom-filters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/randomized-algs-and-ds/monte-carlo-algs-and-ds/bloom-filters/</guid><description>Bloom Filters In true fashion to Stigler&amp;rsquo;s Law of Eponymy (no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer ), Ross Ashby (1960) did a probabilistic analysis of Calvin Mooers&amp;rsquo;s Zatocoding (1947) (coding system for library cards). This predates Burton Bloom&amp;rsquo;s work (1970).
Motivation A Bloom filter for a set \(X: \{x_1, x_2, &amp;hellip;, x_n\} \) from some universe \(\mathbb{U}\) allows one to test whether a given item \(x \in \mathbb{B}\) is an element of \(X\).</description></item></channel></rss>
