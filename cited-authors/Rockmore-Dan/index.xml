Simons had spent 12 years searching for a successful investing formula. In 1989, his net returns were -4.0%. In 1988, he had netted 9.0%. In 1990, he netted 55.0% (77.8% before fees).
With Elywn Berlekamp, game theorist professor at UCB, Simons built a model for selecting idea trades based on data.
Berlekamp knew their approach was alchemic - no cash flows, interest rate forecasts, product research. Some of the trade recommendations didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.</description></item><item><title>Bernoulli Processes</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/mathematics/probability/probability-and-stochastic-systems/02-bernoulli-processes/01-bernoulli-process-and-binomial-rv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/mathematics/probability/probability-and-stochastic-systems/02-bernoulli-processes/01-bernoulli-process-and-binomial-rv/</guid><description>Bernoulli Process A Bernoulli Process is a sequence of independent \({0, 1}\) - valued random variables \(X_1, X_2, X_3, &amp;hellip;\), e.g. \(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1\)
A Bernoulli Process does not mandate that the probability distributions of the \(X_i\) be identical. That is up to the model that we choose. For instance, the Binomial Random Variable assumes \(\mathbb{P}\{X_i = 1\} = p \ \ \forall i\)
Suppose you flip a coin repeatedly, and record \(0\) for tails and \(1\) for heads.</description></item></channel></rss>
