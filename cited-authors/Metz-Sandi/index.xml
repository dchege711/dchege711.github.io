      <description>On Abstractions If you find yourself adding more parameters and if-statements to an existing abstraction, is the abstraction still apt? Why not remove the old abstraction and re-extract a new [more apt] abstraction? Devs frequently succumb to the sunken cost fallacy thinking that there must have been a reason that the code was written in a certain way. 
 is straw-manning though. It&amp;rsquo;s less of a sunk cost fallacy, and more of a Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s Fence situation: Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.</description>
