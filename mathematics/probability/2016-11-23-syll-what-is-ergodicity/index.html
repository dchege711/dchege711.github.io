ensemble of published articles is more or less ergodic.</p><p>More crimes are committed by black persons than by white persons, therefore each
individual black person is not to be trusted? The ensemble of black people is
not at all ergodic!</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This statistic is sometimes used in a dog whistle sense to justify anti-black
racism. Is it a &ldquo;differential involvement hypothesis&rdquo; where Blacks simply commit
more crime into adulthood? Or is it a &ldquo;differential criminal justice system
selection hypothesis&rdquo; where differential police presence, patrolling, profiling,
and judicial discrimination leads to more Blacks being arrested, convicted and
incarcerated? However, when filtered to serious offender populations, there is
little evidence to support the relationship between race and criminal
involvement. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Piquero2008></a></span></p></div></div><h2 id=ergodic--stationary>Ergodic ≠ Stationary</h2><p>Although all ergodic processes are stationary (unconditional joint PDF doesn&rsquo;t
change in time; consequently parameters such as \(\mu, \sigma\) don&rsquo;t change
over time), they are not equivalent:</p><ul><li>Say we have coin A with \( \mathbb{P}\{H\} =.5 \) and coin B with \(
\mathbb{P}\{H\} = .25 \)</li><li>We pick either of the coins with \( p = .5\)</li><li>We toss the coin that we picked repeatedly, noting \(H_1, H_2, H_n\)</li><li>Although the process is stationary, the time average \(H_1 + &mldr; + H_n \)
either converges to \(\frac{1}{2}\) or \(\frac{1}{4} \) with equal
probability.</li><li>The time average depends on the coin you choose, while the probabilistic
average \(\left(\frac{3}{8} \right) \) is calculated for the whole system.</li></ul><h2 id=an-ergodic-system-in-a-sense>An Ergodic System (In a Sense)</h2><p>Say I gave \(n\) people a die each, had them roll their die once. \(
\frac{X_1 + &mldr; + X_n}{n} \) is a finite-sample average which approaches the
ensemble average as \(n \to \infty \).</p><p>Say I rolled a die \(t\) times and calculate \(\frac{X_1 + &mldr; + X_t}{t}\).
This finite-time average approaches the time average as \(t \to \infty \).</p><p>One implication of ergodicity is that ensemble averages will be the same as time
averages. In the first case, as \(n \to \infty \) the randomness is removed
from the system. In the second case, as \(t \to \infty \) the randomness is
removed. But both methods give the same answer, within errors.</p><h2 id=notes-on-ergodicity>Notes on Ergodicity</h2><p>In this sense, rolling dice is an ergodic system. But if we bet on the results
of rolling a die, wealth does not follow an ergodic process under typical
betting rules. If I go bankrupt, I’ll stay bankrupt. So the time average of my
wealth will approach zero as time passes, even though the ensemble average of my
wealth may increase.</p><p>Stationarity is required for ergodicity, for there can be no growth in an
ergodic system. Ergodic systems are zero-sum games. No branching occurs in an
ergodic system, no decision has any consequences because sooner or later we&rsquo;ll
end up in the same situation again and can reconsider.</p><p>The key is that most systems of interest to us, including finance, are
non-ergodic.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>So no free lunch. From a SWE perspective, value comes from solving people&rsquo;s
problems. As long as human systems&rsquo;s are non-ergodic, then big tech is still
poised to develop moats &ndash; small tech doesn&rsquo;t have as many resources to
approximate \(n \to \infty\) or \(t \to \infty\).</p></div></div><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Syll2016>What is Ergodicity?<i></i></cite>
