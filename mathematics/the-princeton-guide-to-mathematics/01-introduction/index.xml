      <description>Motivation for Mathematical Grammar Statements in advanced mathematics have a complicated structure that is easier to understand if one is familiar with mathematical grammar.
Unlike English grammar that can be ambiguous, mathematical grammar is precise.
&amp;hellip; and then we have statistics.
  4 Basic Concepts: Sets, Functions, Relations and Binary Operations The word &amp;ldquo;is&amp;rdquo; can have multiple interpretations:
 5 is the square root of 25 5 is less than 10 5 is a prime number  Mathematically, we can have the following precise statements:</description>
