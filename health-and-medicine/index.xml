      <description>Is Dentistry a Science?  Ferris Jabr. The Atlantic. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/the-trouble-with-dentistry/586039/. May 1, 2019.  Cochrane Oral Health reviews dental procedures in a systematic manner. Unfortunately, most of the reviews don&#39;t find substantive support for dental interventions.
