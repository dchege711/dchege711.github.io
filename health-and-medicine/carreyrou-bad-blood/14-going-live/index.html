            <p>Theranos&rsquo;s Lab was divided into two. The upstairs one, CLIA-certified, was full of commercial diagnostic equipment. The downstairs one had Theranos&rsquo;s tech.</p>
<p>2.5 years of the miniLab&rsquo;s development. But it was still a work in progress. In medical device standards, 3 years is a short time.</p>
<p>Sycophants were promoted. Many employees were on H1-B, so they needed Theranos&rsquo;s employment.</p>
<p>After LTC Shoemaker, Elizabeth scrapped the remote diagnostics. The samples were to be couriered to Palo Alto. Still, Elizabeth insisted that the 4S be a sleek small (consumer) device.</p>
<p>Steve Burd&rsquo;s retirement endangered te Safeway partnership. Another delay risked Walgreens&rsquo;s partnership. Elizabeth had to ship. The 4S wasn&rsquo;t ready, so the Edison was dusted off.</p>
<p>The Siemens ADVIA 1800 diluted the sample in its internals. Therefore Theranos samples were diluted twice. The analytes concentration were below ADVIA&rsquo;s FDA sanctioned levels. Of course, the lawyers suggested they patent how they&rsquo;d tinkered with the ADVIA 1800!</p>
<p>Edison&rsquo;s error rate was too high. Elizabeth chose to launch because she had promised Walgreens. But weren&rsquo;t the customers the patients that would get tested? Who was Elizabeth loyal to?</p>
