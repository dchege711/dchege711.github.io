            <p>Chiat\Day was the agency that Apple had used. Therefore, Theranos would too.</p>
<p>Patrick (Chiat\Day) was enamored by Elizabeth's mission. The website models featured all demographics. Elizabeth scheduled Wednesday meetings because that's how Apple did it.</p>
<p>Stan Fiorito (Chiat\Day) was more circumspect. Sunny's sales targets had measly research. How were they affording $6m/year retainer?</p>
<p>Elizabeth claimed Theranos was saving soldiers&rsquo; lives in Afghanistan. She wanted bold claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>800 tests on a drop of blood</li>
<li>More accurate than traditional lab testing</li>
<li>Tests ready in &lt; 30min</li>
<li>Tests approved by the FDA and endorsed by key medical centers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theranos: 93% of lab mistakes are due to human error. Automating the testing process thus makes us more accurate than other labs.</p>
<p>Elizabeth didn't even ship a device to Johns Hopkins Hospital as per the 2010 meeting.</p>
<p>The time was watered down to &ldquo;4 hours or less&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theranos was still using traditional venous draws for some tests.</p>
<p>On the evening before the launch, the legal team had ordered last-minute changes: &ldquo;Welcome to a revolution in lab testing&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Welcome to Theranos&rdquo; &ldquo;Faster results. Faster answers.&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Fast results. Fast answers.&rdquo; &ldquo;A tiny drop is all it takes&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;A few drops is all it takes&rdquo; &ldquo;Goodbye, big bad needle&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Instead of a huge needle, we can use a tiny finger stick or collect a micro-sample from a venous draw&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Theranos, we can perform all of our lab tests on a sample 1/1000 the size of a typical blood draw&rdquo; -&gt; Remove &lsquo;all of&rsquo; Under &ldquo;Unrivaled accuracy&rdquo;, the 93% statistic claiming that accuracy supremacy was gone.</p>
