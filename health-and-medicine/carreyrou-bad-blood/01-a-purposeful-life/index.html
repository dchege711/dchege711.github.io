            <p>Holmes wanted to be a billionaire since childhood. Her parents were from wealth, with medical and military folk. Holmes attended Houston&rsquo;s most prestigious private school. She spoke her way into Stanford&rsquo;s Mandarin program, <em>while still in high school</em>. Parents insisted on living a purposeful life.</p>
<p>Worked in lab during school year. Freshman internship at Genome Institute of Singapore: nasal swabs and syringes. There had to be a better way.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Ah, the transformative experience abroad.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Fall Sophomore Year. Wrote patent application for arm patch that diagnoses and treats medical conditions. Associate Dean of Engineering school impressed with her inventiveness and motivation: go out and pursue your dream!</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>You&rsquo;d hate to be the one calling bullshit on something that might work. Princeton&rsquo;s Engineering School was also accepting of leaves of absence. However, Dean Bogucki&rsquo;s emails hinted that people come back anyway. In the grand scheme of things, taking time off college to pursue a dream isn&rsquo;t that consequential - if your family has the means to let you do it. I doubt Holmes burned bridges on her way out of Stanford.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Holmes raised ~$6m from VCs through family connections. TheraPatch: adhesive patch with microneedles and chip to control drug dosage; transmis readings to patient&rsquo;s doctor. Theranos pivots to just the diagnostics. Instead of a patch, they&rsquo;d build a handheld device. The revenue would come from licensing tech to pharma to help catch adverse drug reactions during clinical trials.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>As far as pivots go, this one isn&rsquo;t bad. For a moment, I can see sense in narrowing down the market and technical focus.</p>
