Wrote patent application for arm patch that diagnoses and treats medical conditions. Associate Dean of Engineering school impressed with her inventiveness and motivation: go out and pursue your dream!</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>You&rsquo;d hate to be the one calling bullshit on something that might work. Princeton&rsquo;s Engineering School was also accepting of leaves of absence. However, Dean Bogucki&rsquo;s emails hinted that people come back anyway. In the grand scheme of things, taking time off college to pursue a dream isn&rsquo;t that consequential - if your family has the means to let you do it. I doubt Holmes burned bridges on her way out of Stanford.</p></div></div><p>Holmes raised ~$6m from VCs through family connections. TheraPatch: adhesive patch with microneedles and chip to control drug dosage; transmis readings to patient&rsquo;s doctor. Theranos pivots to just the diagnostics. Instead of a patch, they&rsquo;d build a handheld device. The revenue would come from licensing tech to pharma to help catch adverse drug reactions during clinical trials.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>As far as pivots go, this one isn&rsquo;t bad.
