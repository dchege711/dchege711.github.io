Dinner was catered at 8pm to entice longer working days.</p><p>Avie, Steve Job&rsquo;s head of software engineering, joined the board. He questioned rosy revenue projections based on deals whose papers were always in legal review. If the system was being fine tuned, why were there different technical issues holding things up every quarter? Why had the entire exec team changed in a year?</p><p>Avie presented discrepancies to Don Lucas (Chair). Avie asked to resign and waive rights to repurchase Shaunak&rsquo;s (de facto cofounder) stock. Avie resisted and was threatened with lawsuits. Avie decided Theranos wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble.</p><p>Avie&rsquo;s parting letter to Don: <em>&mldr;I do hope you will fully inform the rest of the Board as to what happened here. They deserve to know that by not going along 100% &ldquo;with the program&rdquo; they risk retribution from the Company/Elizabeth.</em></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Holmes does know how to play power politics.</p></div></div></article><div style=font-size:smaller></div></div><footer><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/health-and-medicine/carreyrou-bad-blood/02-the-gluebot/>&#171; 02.
