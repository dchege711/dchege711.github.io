    <div class="comment"><p>Again, if she's faking this belief, then its sociopathic. But <em>maybe</em> she thought she could do it. Inventors go where no one else dares. They're ridiculed by society. <a href="https://quotecatalog.com/quote/rob-siltanen-heres-to-the-c-baVzWoa/">Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.</a></p>

<p>Chat ports were blocked to protect proprietary information and trade secrets. Dinner was catered at 8pm to entice longer working days.</p>
<p>Avie, Steve Job's head of software engineering, joined the board. He questioned rosy revenue projections based on deals whose papers were always in legal review. If the system was being fine tuned, why were there different technical issues holding things up every quarter? Why had the entire exec team changed in a year?</p>
<p>Avie presented discrepancies to Don Lucas (Chair). Avie asked to resign and waive rights to repurchase Shaunak's (de facto cofounder) stock. Avie resisted and was threatened with lawsuits. Avie decided Theranos wasn't worth the trouble.</p>
<p>Avie's parting letter to Don: <em>&hellip;I do hope you will fully inform the rest of the Board as to what happened here. They deserve to know that by not going along 100% &ldquo;with the program&rdquo; they risk retribution from the Company/Elizabeth.</em></p>
