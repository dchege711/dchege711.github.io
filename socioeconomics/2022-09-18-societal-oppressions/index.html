Factors include gender, caste, sex, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, religion,
disability, weight, and physical appearance. These intersecting and overlapping
social identities may be both empowering and oppressing. Criticisms of the
framework: tendency to reduce individuals to specific demographic factors; its
use as an ideological tool against other feminist theories; ambiguous/undefined
goals; reliance on subjective experiences (standpoint theory) leading to
contradictions and inability to generalize. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiIntersectionality></a></span></p></div></div><h2 id=black-racial-identity-development>Black Racial Identity Development</h2><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span>cites Cross for this model. Read Cross&rsquo;s work instead?</p></div></div><p>The stages are presented linearly, but often individuals revisit an earlier
stage as a result of new encounter experiences. However, the subsequent
experience of the stage may be different from the original experience. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=pre-encounter>Pre-Encounter</h3><p>The African American has absorbed many beliefs and values of the dominant White
culture, and seeks to be accepted by Whites, and distances themselves from other
Blacks. The de-emphasis on one&rsquo;s racial-group may contribute to a belief in a US
meritocracy. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Similar: De-emphasizing white privilege allows a white person to hold onto the

of racism in one&rsquo;s life, and the fact that they cannot truly be White. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=immersionemersion>Immersion/Emersion</h3><p>Characterized by the simultaneous desire to surround oneself with visible
symbols of one&rsquo;s racial identity and an active avoidance of symbols of
Whiteness. Tendency to denigrate White people, and glorify Black people. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>With the Encounter and Immersion/Emersion lens, special interest groups, e.g.,
Black Student Union, are not &ldquo;separatist&rdquo;, but an important outlet. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p></div></div><h3 id=internalization>Internalization</h3><p>Secure in one&rsquo;s own sense of racial identity, with less need to assert the
&ldquo;Blacker than thou&rdquo; attitude. Establishing meaningful relationships with Whites
who acknowledge and are respectful of the individual&rsquo;s self-definition. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=internalization-commitment>Internalization-Commitment</h3><p>Translates their personal sense of Blackness to concerns of Blacks as a group,
which is sustained over time. Blackness becomes &ldquo;the point of departure for
discovering the universe of ideas, cultures, and experiences beyond blackness in
place of mistaking blackness as the universe itself.&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h2 id=white-racial-identity-development>White Racial Identity Development</h2><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span>cites Helm&rsquo;s 1990 work. Read that instead?</p></div></div><h3 id=contact>Contact</h3><p>A lack of awareness of cultural and institutional racism, and of one&rsquo;s own White
privilege. Naïve curiosity about or fear of PoC, based on stereotypes. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=disintegration>Disintegration</h3><p>Precipitated by experiences that cultural and institutional racism exist, often
leading to discomfort, e.g., guilt, shame, and anger. Coping mechanisms:
denying/questioning evidence, victim-blaming, withdrawal from PoC and racial
conversations, naïvely trying (and failing) to change attitudes of friends and
family. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=reintegration>Reintegration</h3><p>A desire to be accepted by one&rsquo;s own racial group, even at the cost of reshaping
one&rsquo;s belief system to be more congruent with an acceptance of racism. Blaming
PoC as the source of discomfort. If avoidance of PoC is possible, most Whites
become stuck here. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=pseudo-independent>Pseudo-Independent</h3><p>Precipitated by information-seeking, and abandoning beliefs in White
superiority. Experiences alienation from other Whites, yet may be rejected by
PoC who are suspicious of the individual&rsquo;s motives. Trying to positively
redefine what it means to be White; literature on White antiracist allies to PoC
is empowering. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h3 id=autonomy>Autonomy</h3><p>Antiracist behavior and attitudes are more consistently expressed, allowing
easier forging of alliances with PoC. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h2 id=white-privilege>White Privilege</h2><p><em>&ldquo;My [white] skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to
make. I could think of myself as belonging in major ways, and of making social
systems work for me."</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#McIntosh1990></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#McIntosh1990></a></span>lists 26 instances of white privilege in her life,
e.g. if pulled over by a traffic cop, not being worried that she&rsquo;s been singled
out because of her race.</p></div></div><p>Not all privileges are inevitably damaging; some are <strong>unearned advantage</strong>,
e.g. expecting that race won&rsquo;t count against you in court. These should be the
norm in a just society. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#McIntosh1990></a></span></p><p>Other privileges, e.g. being able to ignore the hostilities against PoC which
exhaust and anger PoC, <strong>confer dominance</strong>. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#McIntosh1990></a></span></p><p>The thinking about equality and equity is incomplete if unearned advantage and
conferred dominance are kept taboo. We shouldn&rsquo;t just try to get folks into a
position of dominance, while denying that <strong>systems</strong> of dominance exist. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#McIntosh1990></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Google Trends for &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; in the US from 2004.</p><script type=text/javascript src=https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3045_RC01/embed_loader.js></script><script type=text/javascript>trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES",{"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/05l021","geo":"US","time":"2004-01-01 2022-09-19"}],"category":0,"property":""},{"exploreQuery":"date=all&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F05l021","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});</script><p>The spike in June 2020 coincide with the murder of George Floyd on May 25th,

individuals to be less frightened when collisions of developmental processes
occur, e.g., a White person not personalizing or feeling threatened by an
African-American&rsquo;s anger during Immersion/Emersion. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><p>Create a safe climate, e.g. confidentiality, mutual respect, no comic-relief
during anxious conversations, and speaking from one&rsquo;s own experience instead of
generalizing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><p>Create opportunities for self-generated knowledge as that tends to be less prone
to denial, e.g., having a White person go apartment hunting with an
African-American person. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><p>Empower learners with the possibility of change, e.g. developing action plans
for interrupting racism, taping an initial interview and replaying it at some
later point to let them see how they&rsquo;ve progressed since. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h2 id=implications-of-teaching-about-race-for-institutions>Implications of Teaching About Race for Institutions</h2><p>In a White-majority environment, educating even a fraction has ripple effects,
e.g. they share literature, involve peers in projects, are better allies in
settings like meetings. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><p>PoC are able to give a voice to their own experience, and to validate it rather
than be demoralized by it. They may be able to move beyond victimization to
empowerment. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tatum1992></a></span></p><h2 id=letter-from-birmingham-jail>Letter from Birmingham Jail</h2><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>What was the main purpose of the Letter from Birmingham Jail? To encourage civil
rights activists to keep advocating despite King&rsquo;s arrest.</p></div></div><p>Direct-action movements are never &ldquo;well-timed&rdquo; because that is on the timetable
of those who have not suffered unduly from segregation. The word &ldquo;wait&rdquo; has
almost always meant &ldquo;never&rdquo;. The white moderate who is more devoted to order
than to justice is the greater stumbling block toward freedom than the White
Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#King1963></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Didn&rsquo;t expect the white moderates to be the subject of MLK&rsquo;s letter. A naïve
take would have been, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re somewhat helping; Aim for the KKK instead.&rdquo; But
maybe it&rsquo;s a matter on how change is effected - the white moderates were the
majority of the group needed to accelerate the civil rights movement. Getting a
10% boost from them is more</p></div></div><p>All too many white religious leaders have been more cautious than courageous,
e.g., calling upon worshippers to comply with desegregation, not because it is
morally right, but because it is the law. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#King1963></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>What are the steps of non-violent campaign? The cause must be clear enough to
not need prose to make apparent. Must identify non-nuanced injustices, such that
the campaign is almost a parody of society.</p></div></div><p>There are four basic steps in a non-violent campaign. First, collect the facts
to determine whether injustices are alive. Birmingham was highly segregated, had
an ugly record of police brutality, and more unsolved racial bombings than any
other city. Second, negotiating with the powers that be on how to end the
injustices. Promises on reform were not honored. Third, self-purification.
Workshops on non-violence and restraint against retaliating. Fourth, direct
action. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#King1963></a></span></p><p>Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such
creative tension that a community that has consistently refused to negotiate
is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to dramatize the issue that it can no
longer be ignored. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#King1963></a></span></p><p>One force comprises of Negroes who have adjusted to segregation and those who,
having risen to the middle class and at times profit by segregation, have become
insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness
and hatred that comes close to advocating violence. Nonviolent direct action is
a creative outlet for the normal and healthy discontent. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#King1963></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>What is the difference between just and unjust laws? If a certain law were
reverted, would society be better overall? If so, then that law is unjust.</p></div></div><p>Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human
personality is unjust. An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a
minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the
other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow,
and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. A law can
be just on its face and unjust in its application, e.g., requiring a permit for
a parade, and then denying civil rights activists said permits. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#King1963></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-graduation-cap" cited-by-count=2083 is-main><cite id=Tatum1992>Talking about Race, Learning about Racism: The Application of Racial Identity Development Theory in the Classroom<i>.</i></cite>
