<i class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" aria-hidden=true></i></div><p>Start with hippie good intentions. A generation embracing new technology as a tool to transform the world for good.</p><ul><li>Can Duruk: <em>You were going to Facebook not to work but to make the world more open and connected.</em></li></ul><p>Mix in capitalism on steroids. To save the world, you first need to take it over. Turns out the scale and power was also good for making money.</p><p>After the stock market crash, Wall Street came looking West. FB had become a social-media success.</p><ul><li>Garcia Martinez: <em>It wasn&rsquo;t just the hippies showing up anymore. There was a lot more of the libertarian, screw-the-government ethos, that whole idea of move-fast-break-things-and-damn-the-consequences that still flies under the marketing shell of &lsquo;making the world a better place&rsquo;</em></li></ul><p>To avoid charging consumers for the internet they turned to digital ads. They needed a large audience and personal data.</p><ul><li>Rich Kyanka: They wanted more people on their platforms. They didn&rsquo;t care if the people were good. They just wanted more bodies with different IP addresses loading up ads.</li></ul><p>Everything was designed to be really <del>addictive</del> engaging.</p><ul><li>Jaron Lanier: <em>Anger is the emotion most effective at driving &lsquo;engagement&rsquo; - which also makes it, in a market for attention, the most profitable one.</em></li></ul><p>None of the companies lied about how their money was made. But as users became deeply surveilled, the leading digital platforms became wildly popular.</p><p>No one from the Valley was held accountable. Why bring such a wealthy, dynamic sector to heel? Algorithms have no moral agency, they said.</p><p>Even as social networks became dangerous and toxic, user security and protection from abuse took a backseat to growth and engagement.</p><p>The more features they added, the more data users willingly, if unwittingly, released to them. Concerns were drowned by the oohs and aahs of consumers, investors and journalists.</p><p>Come 2016. Twitter was Trump&rsquo;s megaphone. Google helped pro-Trump forces target users most susceptible to crass Islamophobia. Reddit & 4chan were breeding grounds for the alt-right. Facebook was the weapon of choice for Russian trolls and Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Employees are starting to revolt. There&rsquo;s less of a moral positive now - you go to Facebook to write some code and then you go home.</p><p>To fix it, we&rsquo;ll need a new business model. Maybe something radical like charging users for goods and services. And some tough regulation. Maybe nothing will change - the incumbents are too rich, powerful and addictive.</p></article><div style=font-size:smaller><aside id=tags-holder style="margin:0 0 2%">Tags:
