Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.</description>

On the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a &amp;ldquo;1202 program alarm&amp;rdquo;. On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: &amp;ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s perfectly norma&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; The ship computer bursts into flames.
You notify the Elves that the computer&#39;s magic smoke seems to have escaped. &amp;ldquo;That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!</description>
