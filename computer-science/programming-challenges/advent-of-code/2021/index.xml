      <description>This page contains remarks on Haskell that I encountered when working with source files that span multiple AoC 2021 problems.
 and  have Haskell solutions. It&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare how they solved the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up perfecting the wrong approach!
Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal   and Stack   are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 01: Sonar Sweep</title>

      <description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021: Sonar Sweep.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 18, 2022.  Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description>

      <description>Day 2 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 19, 2022.  Problem Statement Part One Now, you need to figure out how to pilot this thing.
It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like forward 1, down 2, or up 3:
 forward X increases the horizontal position by X units. down X increases the depth by X units. up X decreases the depth by X units.</description>

      <description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 23, 2022.  Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 04: Giant Squid</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/GiantSquid/</link>

      <description>Day 4 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 25, 2022.  Part One You&amp;rsquo;re already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can&amp;rsquo;t see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
Maybe it wants to play bingo   ?</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 05: Hydrothermal Venture</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/HydrothermalVenture/05-hydrothermal-venture/</link>

      <guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/HydrothermalVenture/05-hydrothermal-venture/</guid>
      <description>Problem Statement Part One You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.
They tend to form in lines; the submarine hopefully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review.
Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format (x1, y1 -&amp;gt; x2, y2), where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end of the line segment, and x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end.</description>

      <description>Day 6 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 2, 2022.  Part I Description The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?
A massive school of glowing lanternfish swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe exponentially quickly? You should model their growth to be sure.
Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes.</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 07: The Treachery of Whales</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/TreacheryOfWhales/</link>

      <guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/TreacheryOfWhales/</guid>
      <description>Day 7 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 5, 2022.  Part I Description A giant whale has decided that your submarine is its next meal, and it&amp;rsquo;s much faster than you are. There&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to run!
Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it&amp;rsquo;s too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they&amp;rsquo;re aiming!</description>

      <title>AoC 2021 Day 08: Seven Segment Search</title>
      <link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</link>

      <guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/programming-challenges/advent-of-code/2021/src/AoC2021/SevenSegmentSearch/</guid>
      <description>Day 8 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Mar 7, 2022.  Part I Description You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape.</description>

      <description>This is a sample note.  \begin{code}  module Lanternfish.Lanternfish (fact) where  fact :: Int -&amp;gt; Int fact :: Int -&amp;gt; Int fact Int 0 = Int 1 fact Int n = Int n Int -&amp;gt; Int -&amp;gt; Int forall a. Num a =&amp;gt; a -&amp;gt; a -&amp;gt; a * Int -&amp;gt; Int fact(Int nInt -&amp;gt; Int -&amp;gt; Int forall a. Num a =&amp;gt; a -&amp;gt; a -&amp;gt; a -Int 1)  \end{code}  {{% comment %}}  Can I still do Hugo shortcodes?</description>
