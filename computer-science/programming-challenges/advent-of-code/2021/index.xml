      <description>Day 1 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 18, 2022.  Problem Statement Part One As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar weep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.</description>

      <description>Day 2 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 19, 2022.  Problem Statement Part One Now, you need to figure out how to pilot this thing.
It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like forward 1, down 2, or up 3:
 forward X increases the horizontal position by X units. down X increases the depth by X units. up X decreases the depth by X units.</description>

      <description>Day 3 - Advent of Code 2021.  adventofcode.com  .  Accessed Feb 23, 2022.  Problem Description Part One The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.
The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.</description>

      <title>Learning Haskell via AoC 2021</title>

      <description>This page contains remarks on Haskell that I encountered when working with source files that span multiple AoC 2021 problems.
 and  have Haskell solutions. It&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare how they solved the problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up perfecting the wrong approach!
Setting Up Haskell Env for AoC To manage dependencies, Cabal   and Stack   are pretty popular. Stack incorporates the Cabal build system.</description>
