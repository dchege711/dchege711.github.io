to address future problems and requirements is hard. New designers tend to be
overwhelmed by the options available. Expert designers do not solve every
problem from first principles; they reuse design patterns. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I&rsquo;ve also encountered the &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t gonna need it&rdquo; (YAGNI) school of thought

like they exist somewhere between designing for now, and designing for a
possible future. A design pattern solves a specific problem being encountered
<em>now.</em> And even within a design pattern, one could still adhere to YAGNI, and
add pieces when needed. When it does come to the point where the design needs
more features, at least the design pattern provides a mental framework that is
consistent with the initial design of the system.</p></div></div><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>What is a design pattern? A collection of choices on how to go about solving a
problem when designing systems. Sample problems: state synchronization,
ownership relations, etc.</p></div></div><p>A design pattern has 4 elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Pattern name:</strong> succinctly describes the design problem, its solutions, and
its consequences.</li><li><strong>Problem:</strong> describes when to apply the pattern, e.g., how to represent
algorithms as objects.</li><li><strong>Solution:</strong> describes the elements that make up the design, their
relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.</li><li><strong>Consequences:</strong> the results and tradeoffs of applying the pattern, e.g.,
space/time, language implementation issues, extensibility, etc.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span></p><p>Design patterns are not about designs such as hash tables that can be encoded in
classes and reused as-is. Nor are they complex, domain-specific designs for an
entire application or subsystem. Instead, they are descriptions of communicating
objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a
particular context. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span></p><p>Why use a design pattern?</p><ul><li>Helps you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable.</li><li>Improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by adding
explicit specifications of class and object interactions, and their underlying
intent.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>With the explicit goal of reusability, keep an eye out when we trade off some
other desirable quality, like computational efficiency.</p></div></div><p>While experienced devs use design patterns exclusively, there is no good
recording of the various design patterns used. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span>aims to present a catalog of design patterns, and with a consistent format:
<em>name(s), classification, intent, motivation, applicability, graphical
representation, participating classes/objects and their responsibilities,
collaborations between participants, consequences, implementation notes, sample
code, known uses, related patterns.</em></p><p>The choice of programming language is important because the language features
determine what can and cannot be implemented easily. For example, CLOS has
multi-methods, which lessen the need for a pattern such as Visitor. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span></p><p>The Model/View/Controller (MVC) triad of classes used to build UI in
Smalltalk-80 helps illustrate various design patterns:</p><figure><img src=/img/computer-science/gang-of-4/mvc-diagram.jpg alt="MVC diagram. Credits: GangOfFour1994-Ch1"><figcaption><p>MVC diagram. Credits: GangOfFour1994-Ch1</p></figcaption></figure><ul><li>MVC has a design that decouples views from models. The more general problem is
<em>decoupling objects so that changes to one can affect any number of others
without requiring the changed object to know the details of the others.</em> The
general design is described by the <strong>Observer</strong> design pattern.</li><li>In MVC, a view can be composed of other views. The more general problem is
<em>grouping objects and treating the group like an individual object.</em> The
general design is described by the <strong>Composite</strong> design pattern.</li><li>MVC lets one change how a view responds to user input without changing the
visual representation, by encapsulating the response mechanism in a Controller
object, e.g., a disabled view is given a controller that ignores input events.
This View-Controller relationship is an example of the <strong>Strategy</strong> design
pattern.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GangOfFour1994-Ch1></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=GangOfFour1994-Ch1>Design Patterns<i>.</i>
