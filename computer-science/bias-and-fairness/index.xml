These affect (a) what data was selected, and (b) the labels assigned to the examples. They propose the \(\text{Fair-SMOTE}\) (Fair Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique) algorithm which (1) removes biased labels (via situation testing: if the model&amp;rsquo;s prediction for a data point changes once all of the data points' protected attributes are flipped, then that label is biased and the data point is discarded), and (2) rebalances internal distributions such that based on a protected attribute, examples are equal in both positive and negative classes.</description></item><item><title>Rage Against the Algorithm</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/bias-and-fairness/2021-07-04-rage-against-the-algo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/bias-and-fairness/2021-07-04-rage-against-the-algo/</guid><description>The lack of explanability is a common theme. Higher-ups claim the machine is unbiased, while the workers on the ground say, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not me; it&amp;rsquo;s the computer&amp;rdquo;.
