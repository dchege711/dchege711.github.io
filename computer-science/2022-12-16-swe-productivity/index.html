<h3 id="devs-diverging-perceptions-of-productivity">Devs' Diverging Perceptions of Productivity</h3>



<div class="priors-holder">
    <div class="priors"><p>Got interested in measuring it two years into my SWE career.</p>
<p>Initially rated myself based on % of completed daily objectives. The objectives
didn&rsquo;t necessarily correspond to work items. Stopped because the numbers were
high even on days when I didn&rsquo;t feel productive.</p>
<p>Switched to &ldquo;stuff that affects others&rdquo; (later came to know these are &ldquo;function
points&rdquo;). More intuitively captures non-code objectives, e.g., aligning folks on
feature specs. Numbers seem low; never a double digit month. Open question on
how to incorporate code reviews into my daily rating.</p>
<p>Burn-down chart is underwhelming. Maybe the items are too broad? Or am I not as
productive as I presume?</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Majority of the scholarship is on top-down perspectives that measure artifact
output per unit of time, e.g., LoC modification per hour, resolution time for
modification requests, function points created per month, etc. However, this
misses developers' individual work roles, practices, work fragmentation,
tooling, office environment, etc. For example, a dev who spends a lot of time
supporting co-workers might develop less code, and appear less productive. In
contrast, a bottom-up approach better understands individual work habits, how
they relate to productivity perceptions, and which factors are most important
for a dev&rsquo;s productivity. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch12"></a></span></p>
<p>Devs context switch on average 13 times an hour. They may still feel productive,
because the cost of context switching varies. Writing a quick email while
waiting for a build to complete does not harm productivity, while discussing an
unrelated topic with a co-worker is a costly context switch. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch12"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>It would actually feel unproductive to <em>not</em> switch contexts when waiting on a
build to complete.</p>
</div>
</div>





<div class="priors-holder">
    <div class="priors"><p>What is unproductive work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting with CI over linting that can&rsquo;t be semi-automated.</li>
<li>Meetings w/o a scoped agenda.</li>
<li>Incidental costs, e.g., flaky tests, merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Wrangling with tools, e.g., long compilation times.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<p>On an average 8.4h workday, devs spend on average 4.3h on their computer, with
\(\approx\) 2.1h on coding-related activities. Majority consider coding as the
most productive activity. Meetings were the most controversial; opposers cited
lack of goals/outcomes, and too many attendees. No single activity was
unanimously considered exclusively productive or unproductive, e.g., coding is
not productive when the dev is blocked on a task. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch12"></a></span></p>
<p>Asked to quantify their productivity, most want number of completed tasks to be
augmented by other measures, e.g., LoC, # bugs found/fixed, emails sent, etc. No
single measure or combination of measures were consistently rated higher by
most. The measures depend on the context, e.g., using the number of tasks
completed is accurate for a dev that spends most of their time coding, as
opposed to meetings or helping co-workers. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch12"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment open-comment"><p>How can trends be gleaned? Consecutive days may have different contexts, e.g.
Monday is meeting-heavy, and Tuesday is coding-heavy. If rating each day to a
percentage, how is 100% determined?</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>From hourly self-reports of productivity ratings, three clusters that are
similar to the circadian rhythm emerge: morning people (20%), low-at-lunch
people, and afternoon-people (%40). Asked to rate what is productive vs.
unproductive, six clusters emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Social developers</em> love collaborating and doing code reviews.</li>
<li><em>Lone developers</em> avoid interruptions like noise, email, meetings, and code
reviews, preferring quiet.</li>
<li><em>Focused developers</em> feel productive while working efficiently, and
unproductive when stuck or interrupted.</li>
<li><em>Balanced developers</em> are less affected by distractions, but feel unproductive
when tasks are unclear or unfamiliar, or causing overhead.</li>
<li><em>Leading developers</em> prefer meetings, emails, writing specs, and feel less
productive with coding activities.</li>
<li><em>Goal-oriented developers</em> feel productive when they cross off (or make
progress on) tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These clusters can be used to tailor process improvements to the different types
of developers. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch12"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>So far, I&rsquo;m interested in what I, as an non-manager, can do to boost the team&rsquo;s
productivity in a mostly C++ environment. So far, most of this feels actionable
only from a managerial position.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2 id="factors-that-are-causally-linked-with-perceived-productivity">Factors that Are Causally Linked with Perceived Productivity</h2>
<p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Cheng2022"></a></span> draws stronger causal inferences (with fewer confounding
factors) about productivity drivers in ecologically valid settings (as opposed
to non-representative dev environments) than prior works.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>To draw stronger causal inferences, <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Cheng2022"></a></span> use <strong>panel data
analysis</strong> instead of the more typical cross-sectional data analysis. The data
came from tooling logs (e.g. code review tool), and the company-wide Engineering
Satisfaction survey.</p>
<p>The dependent variable, productivity, was coded from the dev&rsquo;s answer to the
&ldquo;Overall, in the past 3 months, how productive have you felt at
Google/Alphabet?&rdquo; question in the EngSat survey. Subjective measures of
productivity are easy to collect, have more literature, and have been shown to
be correlated with objective measures like the median active coding time.</p>
<p>For the independent variables, both subjective and objective measures were used,
e.g. satisfaction with project code quality, project tech debt, innovativeness
of tools and infrastructure, 50th and 90th percentile of rounds of code review,
total time spent in meetings, etc.</p>
<p>In panel data analysis, the delta in each individual&rsquo;s responses and metrics are
tracked. This should eliminate time invariant effects, e.g. prior education,
that must explicitly accounted for in longitudinal studies lest they be
confounding factors. That said, time variant effects, e.g. Alice getting a
mentor who impacts her productivity, cannot be ruled out by the analysis.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lower perceived productivity is causally related to satisfaction with project
(but not dependencies) code quality, perceived technical debt, non-innovative
tools/infra, too many/few choices of tools/infra, pace of change in dev tool
stack that is too fast/slow, having to learn new tooling/infra/framework, longer
build times, longer build &amp; test cycle, multiple rounds of reviews per code
review, slow code review, shifting project priorities, more changes of direct
managers, hindrance by team and organizational reasons, and complicated team
processes. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Cheng2022"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Conventional panel data analysis can only establish the presence of a causal
relation, but not the direction of the causality. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Cheng2022"></a></span> do
lagged panel analysis to tease out directionality for the relationship between
code quality and productivity. A 100% increase of satisfaction with project code
quality at time \(T-1\) was associated with a \(10\%\) decrease of median
coding time per change-list (CL), a \(12\%\) decrease of median wall-clock
time from creating to mailing a CL, and a \(22\%\) decrease of median
wall-clock time from submitting to deploying a CL at time \(T\). On the other
hand, changes in satisfaction with project code quality in time \(T\) were not
associated with any of the productivity metrics in time \(T-1\). The data
supports the hypothesis that changes in code quality during time \(T-1\) are
correlated with changes in productivity at time \(T\). <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Cheng2022"></a></span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Some notable factors that did not have a statistically significant relationship
with perceived productivity: poor/missing documentation, actual time spent in
meetings, physical distance from manager, physical distance from code reviewers,
and organizational distance from code reviewers. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Cheng2022"></a></span></p>

<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment open-comment"><p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span> mentions <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Humphrey1995"></a></span>&rsquo;s work to
help developers track their estimated and actual development of code. See what
Humphrey has to say?</p>
</div>
</div>





<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Following a literature review, 400-dev survey, and 5 pilot studies with 20 devs,
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span> built (and later open-sourced)
PersonalAnalytics. It collects data in the background about application use,
documents assessed, sites visited, code reviews, emails, etc. Every hour, it
prompts the dev to rate their productivity. Captured data is visualized in the
app.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Personalization and customization increased satisfaction and long-term
engagement. Devs wanted to personalize which measures were tracked and
visualized. They requested for more data, e.g. comparison with teammates,
correlating with biometric data such as stress level, sleep, and exercise, etc.
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span></p>
<p>The popup asking to self-report productivity for the past hour increases
awareness about efficiency, and prompts a change tactics if need be. They valued
that they&rsquo;re the ones who rate their productivity, as an automated measure
wouldn&rsquo;t accurately capture. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span></p>
<p>The retrospection increases self-awareness and provided novel insights, e.g.,
time actually spent with emails, misconceptions that they&rsquo;re more productive in
the morning, etc. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span></p>
<p>Actionability was ambivalent. Half were able to update behavior, e.g. taking
advantage of more productive afternoons. Others requested that the tool provide
recommendations based on the data collected. Even better, being able to set a
goal and then monitor their progress towards reaching it. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span></p>
<p>Focusing only on individual insights may miss team opportunities, e.g.,
scheduling meetings when everyone is least productive, and sometimes harm team
productivity, e.g., dev blocking out interruptions at inopportune times. To
account for privacy, the tool only stored the logs locally on the user&rsquo;s
machine. While some devs voluntarily shared their visualizations and insights
with teammates to compare themselves, some said they&rsquo;d start to game the tool,
or even leave the company if their manager forced them to run a tracking tool
that would ignore their privacy concerns. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Zimmermann2019-Ch22"></a></span> mention sharing anonymized or aggregated data
with the rest of the team as a future improvement to the tool. Isn&rsquo;t this
something that
