code does. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p></div></div><p>The later a bug is caught in the development cycle, the more expensive it is to
fix it. A good test today is a future debugging session saved. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>The test is the first client of your code. It uncovers sub-optimal design
choices, tight couplings, missed cases, etc.. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Some test failures are hard to debug, and slow down development, e.g. flaky
tests.</p></div></div><p>As a code base grows, poorly written test suites become counter-productive, e.g.
instability, slowness, etc.. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>As the team size grows, programmer ability is insufficient to avoid defects. For
instance, a 100-person team of devs that only write a single bug each month will
have 5 new bugs every workday. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Catches regressions in functionality, e.g. during refactoring, syncing with an
upstream project, etc.. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p></div></div><p>Automated testing turns the team members' collective wisdom into a benefit for
the entire team. Everyone can run the test and will benefit when it detects an
issue. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>Manual testing (e.g. QA department) doesn&rsquo;t scale well, especially when the
software has multiple libraries/frameworks, platforms, user configurations, and
intra-day releases. However, some tests, e.g. testing the quality of search
results, often involves qualitative human judgment. Humans are also better at
searching for complex security vulnerabilities, which can then be added to an
automated security testing system, once the flaw is understood. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>Expressing tests as code instead of a series of manual steps allows us to run
the tests each time the code changes, and modularize the tests to be executed
in various environments. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Up-to-date documentation of how a class or function is meant to be used. Less
likely to go stale compared to comments. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p></div></div><p>Tests work best as documentation only if the tests are kept clear and concise.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>Tests help simplify reviews. A code reviewer need not mentally walk through
scenarios to check code correctness, edge cases, and error conditions. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Sometimes I do the opposite: be meticulous when reviewing code, and then blaze
through the test files assuming that if the tests are wrong, then they&rsquo;d fail in
CI. I need to get better at reviewing test files, and identifying holes in
tests.</p></div></div><p>The reason for the lack of automated tests may be more nuanced, e.g. pain from
legacy tests, early stages where it&rsquo;s about validating the idea, etc.. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Lent2019></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Designing code that has testable interfaces, such that writing the tests is not
arduous. Also important is not over-complicating the code just to allow for
testing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#HNLent2019></a></span></p></div></div><h2 id=designing-a-test-suite>Designing a Test Suite</h2><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>A test suite is a collection of tests that is ran to verify that a feature is
working correctly.</p><p>My opinions on what makes a good test suite is influenced by my experiences with
Google Test (C++), Jest (TS, JS), Mocha (TS, JS), PyTest (Python), and HUnit
(Haskell).</p></div></div><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Each programming language has competing frameworks for writing tests. The
languages themselves seldom come with adequate frameworks. Learning the specific
framework becomes yet another thing, but framework share some commonalities,
e.g. pre-test setup functions, hierarchical tests, etc..</p></div></div><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>There are 3 modes of testing: unit tests, integration tests and black-box tests.
The first two are aware of the source code details, while the third one is
performed on an already-compiled program.</p></div></div><p>The <strong>size</strong> of a test refers to the resources required to run a test, e.g.
memory, processes, time, etc.. The <strong>scope</strong> of a test refers to the specific
code paths that are verified (and not just executed!) in the test. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>A taxonomy based on size (rather than &ldquo;unit&rdquo;, &ldquo;integration&rdquo;, etc.) is more
useful because speed and determinism of the test suite matter, regardless of the
scope of the test. Sources of test slowness and/or non-determinism (flakiness)
include blocking calls (e.g. <code>sleep</code>), clock time, thread scheduling, network
access and latency, disk access, and third-party processes. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p><strong>Small tests</strong>, must run on the same process as the code being tested. Any
network or disk access must be to a hermetic in-memory implementation. <strong>Medium
tests</strong> must be contained within a single machine, but can span multiple
processes (e.g. a real database instance), use threads, make blocking calls, and
make network calls to <code>localhost</code>. <strong>Large tests</strong> do not have the <code>localhost</code>
restriction, and can span multiple machines. Tooling can be configured to
enforce size constraints, e.g. a custom test runner that fails small tests that
attempt to establish a network connection. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p><strong>Narrow-scoped tests</strong> (<em>unit tests</em>) validate the logic in an individual class
or method. <strong>Medium-scoped tests</strong> (<em>integration tests</em>) verify interactions
between a small number of components, e.g. server and database. <strong>Large-scoped
tests</strong> (<em>functional tests, end-to-end tests, system tests</em>) validate
interaction of several distinct parts of the system, and emergent behaviors that
aren&rsquo;t expressed in a single class or method. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><p>Ideally, most of the tests should be narrow-scoped unit tests that validate
business logic, and then medium-scoped integration tests, and finally few
large-scoped end-to-end tests. Suites with many end-to-end tests but few
integration and unit tests are a symptom of rushing to production without
addressing testing debt. Suites with many end-to-end and unit-tests but few
integration tests may suffer from tightly coupled components. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>A good test suite should support running a subset of tests (multiple times if
need be), hooks for setting up and tearing down a test case, independence of
various test cases (the order of running the tests shouldn&rsquo;t matter), and
temporarily disabling tests.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span>uses &ldquo;hermetic&rdquo; to describe tests that contain all of
the information necessary to set up, execute and tear down their environments.</p></div></div></div></div><p>A test should be obvious upon introspection. There are no tests for the tests
themselves, so avoid complex test flows, e.g. conditionals and loops. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>The test suite should support analyses such as: identifying flaky tests,
generating code coverage reports, surfacing troubleshooting info (e.g. logs,
repro commands), etc.</p></div></div><p>Flaky tests are expensive. If each test has a 0.1% of failing when it should
not, and one runs 10,000 tests per day, then there will be 10 flakes to
investigate each day. As flakiness increases (past 1%), devs stop reacting to
test failures. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Attaining 100% test coverage, especially covering all possible code paths, is
difficult in large code bases. Are there tools that help developers be more
judicious as to which code paths are tested?</p></div></div><p><span id=CodeCoverage>Code coverage can flag untested code, but it shouldn&rsquo;t
be used as a proxy for how well a system is tested. Code coverage measures code
that was invoked, and not code that was validated. Coverage should be used for
small tests to avoid coverage inflation. Even further, devs tend to treat
coverage targets as ceilings rather than floors, i.e. not adding tests as soon
as the coverage threshold is met. Instead of relying on coverage numbers, assess
your confidence that everything your customers expect to work will work, given
that the tests are passing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Choosing what to test is sometimes not obvious. Some tests are almost
tautological or paranoid.</p></div></div><p>The Beyoncé Rule: <em>If you liked it, then you shoulda put a test on it.</em>
Everything that you don&rsquo;t want to break should be in a test, e.g. performance,
behavioral correctness, accessibility, security, etc.. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to get a 100% true representation of what the end-user sees.
Tests frequently mock out parts of the systems that are being tested.</p></div></div><p>Brittle tests - those that over-specify expected outcomes or rely on extensive
and complicated boilerplate - can resist change. The misuse of mock objects is
a prolific source of brittleness. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=priors-holder><div class=priors><p>Running tests before checking in code is usually provided by some paid service
like Travis CI. Some projects, e.g. personal ones, may not have such funds.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Maybe this is not a concern for feature teams? Neither <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span>nor <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Lent2019></a></span>address this. Maybe I&rsquo;m over-exaggerating the cost
of running CI tests, especially when weighed against the cost of <em>not</em> running
CI tests.</p></div></div></div></div><h2 id=improving-testing-culture>Improving Testing Culture</h2><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Learn how to spot and use momentum from Watershed moments. In 2005, the Google
Web Server project lead instituted a policy of engineer-driven, automated
testing, e.g. new code had to have tests, and tests would be run continuously.
Within a year of the policy, despite record numbers of new changes, the number
of emergency pushes dropped by half. However, instead of issuing similar
mandates to the rest of Google, the Testing Grouplet was focused on
demonstrating success, in the belief that successful ideas would spread. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p></div></div><p>During orientation, new engineers were taught about testing as if it were
standard practice at Google. The new engineers would quickly outnumber existing
team members, and helped bring about cultural change. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Lent2019></a></span>had a different experience. As a new hire, she was very
keen at testing, but lost steam due to existing team members' disinclinations.</p></div></div><p>A &ldquo;Test Certified&rdquo; program with levels 1 to 5, and each level having goals
achievable in a quarter. Level 1: set up a continuous build; start tracking code
coverage; classify all tests as small, medium, or large; identify flaky tests;
create a set of fast tests. Level 5: all tests are automated; fast tests ran
before every commit; all non-determinism removed; every behavior covered. An
internal dashboard showing the level of each team sparked competition. &ldquo;Test
Certified&rdquo; was later replaced with an automated approach: Project Health (pH).
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>To improve testing culture, there was support in terms of dedicated teams, e.g.
The Testing Grouplet; various engineering productivity teams <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span>. Being able to have a dedicated group seems crucial.</p></div></div><p>Testing on the Toilet (TotT). Weekly flyers on how to improve testing were
placed in restroom stalls. An email newsletter would have been lost in the
noise. TotT&rsquo;s reception was polarized (e.g. invasion of personal space), but the
uproar subsided. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#TotT></a></span>has online versions of the flyers. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SWEGoogleCh11></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=SWEGoogleCh11>Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned From Programming Over Time<i>.</i>
