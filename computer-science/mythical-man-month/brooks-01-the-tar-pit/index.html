The last difficult bugs take more time to find than the first.</li></ul></li><li>The product appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion.<ul><li>The obsolescence of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts.</li><li>The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</li></ul></li></ul></article><div style=font-size:smaller></div></div><footer><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/mythical-man-month/brooks-02-the-mythical-man-month/>02.
