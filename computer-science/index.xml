      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674. Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&#39;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>Signal Is Finally Bringing Its Secure Messaging To the Masses.  Andy Greenberg. https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/. https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/02/14/2216214/signal-is-finally-bringing-its-secure-messaging-to-the-masses#comments. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22326731. Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&#39;d think that at Signal&#39;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&#39;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&#39;t look like it will monetize soon.
  Signal has added support for iPad, ephemeral images and video, downloadable customizable &amp;ldquo;stickers,&amp;rdquo; and emoji reactions.</description>

      <description>Dependencies and Maintainers.  Drew DeVault. https://drewdevault.com/2020/02/06/Dependencies-and-maintainers.html. Feb 6, 2020.  Sample Crises in OSS left-pad: trivial library that was removed from npm and was unknowingly present in thousands of dependency graphs.
event-stream: maintainer transferred ownership to an unknown individual who added crypto mining
heartbleed, in which a bug in a critical security library caused mass upgrades and panic
DeVault&#39;s Take Asking how to prioritize attention, donations &amp;amp; patches for thousands of OSS library dependencies shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</description>
