      <description>New grad vs senior dev.  Eric Lipppert. Fabulous adventures in coding. https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/27/new-grad-vs-senior-dev/ . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22352674 . Mar 27, 2020.  Substring Search in Visual Basic In CS, substring search is a foundational problem for which there are \(O(m + n)\) algorithms. But VB&amp;rsquo;s implementation was \(O(mn)\). Suppose we have InStr(&amp;quot;apple banana orange&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;):
 Skip to the first b. Check if banana is a substring starting from that b. If banana was not found, skip to the next b.</description>

      <description>Signal Is Finally Bringing Its Secure Messaging To the Masses.  Andy Greenberg. https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/ . https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/02/14/2216214/signal-is-finally-bringing-its-secure-messaging-to-the-masses#comments . https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22326731 . Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&amp;rsquo;d think that at Signal&amp;rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t touch my clipboard [Alex Ellis] [] Complaint: Alex selected &amp;amp; copied an em dash ( - ) character from https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html, but here&amp;rsquo;s what the site put into the clipboard:

      <description>Garbage Collection Garbage Collection is about simulating a computer with infinite memory. Consequently, if you have more RAM than your program will ever need, then a null garbage collector is a valid one. [] []

      <title>Software Vulnerabilities Introduced by Dependencies</title>

      <description>Identifying Vulnerabilities No matter the obfuscation in the source code, the malicious package will have to make system calls in order to do anything interesting. These system calls are easier to analyze. []
Suggestions Know your dependencies by heart. Know the maintainers. Be aware of problems going on in the project and help, e.g. patches, funding sources, etc. []

      <description>Mergeable Replicated Data Types [] On a distributed system, each replica should [eventually] converge to the same state. Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) can accept updates and achieve consistent without remote synchronization.
The Need for Commutativity Say we have a queue \( 1 \to 2 \). Suppose two replicas, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), independently call pop(). Each replica will have \(2\) on their queue.
However, on receiving an update that the other replica popped, each replica will call pop() to be consistent, thereby deleting \(2\).</description>
