<p>Kissinger's waking call was the triumph of AlphaGo. He is wary of the self-learning machine.</p>
<p>The printing press sparked the Age of Reason. However, a world reliant on data &amp; algorithms, uncontrollable by ethical/philosophical norms will upend the Age of Reason. The people developing AI care more about technical feats than ethical/philosophical issues.</p>
<p>Harbingers of the end of enlightenment: <em>information overload diverts people from introspection, ability to target micro-groups breaks up the previous consensus on priorities</em>.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>How can a politician keep his priorities aligned with the majority, when the minority are the most vocal? <a href="https://medium.com/civic-tech-thoughts-from-joshdata/so-you-want-to-reform-democracy-7f3b1ef10597">Getting people to participate is hard</a> <a href="https://www.c13u.com/politics-and-governance/2015-11-22-so-you-want-to-reform-democracy/">[summary]</a></p>

<p>What if a self-driving car were forced to choose between killing a grandparent and killing a child?</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Devil's Advocate: Would a human do better? At least the car won't live with the trauma. Or maybe that's the scary part - an AI feels no remorse nor pain?</p>

<h2 id="3-major-concerns">3 Major Concerns</h2>
<p>AI may achieve unintended results. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html">Tay became racist after mingling with humans</a>. If we humans can't agree, how could we teach machines to agree on what is right?</p>
<p>The single-mindedness of AI in achieving goals may change human thought processes and values.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I fail to see how this is crucial. Sure, AlphaGo just wants to win, while a human may be playing for fun. So what?</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>AI may reach intended goals, but be unable to explain the rationale for its conclusions.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>A lot of research has been going into explainable AI, so that's good. We also have courts mandating that if an algorithm is not explainable, then it can't be used to judge a person. However, even when the computer explains everything, <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">that may not be enough</a> <a href="https://www.c13u.com/technology/miscellaneous/2018-09-21-boston-public-school-equity-algorithm/">[summary]</a></p>
