boundaries of technology, it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re dealing with ambiguity: unclear
direction; messy, complicated humans; or legacy systems with behavior you can&rsquo;t
predict. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>As a tech lead, the folks working on the project may not be reporting to you,
but you&rsquo;re responsible for the result. You&rsquo;re thinking about the whole problem,
including parts of it that aren&rsquo;t really anyone&rsquo;s job. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h2 id=the-start-of-a-project>The Start of a Project</h2><h3 id=if-youre-feeling-overwhelmed>If You&rsquo;re Feeling Overwhelmed&mldr;</h3><p>It takes time and energy to build the mental maps that let you navigate it all.
The difficulty is the point. Ambiguity is the nature of the work &ndash; if it wasn&rsquo;t
messy and difficult, they wouldn&rsquo;t need you. You got to the lead role with
credibility and social capital &ndash; ten mistakes will not destroy you. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Create a document to act as an external part of your brain for the project&rsquo;s
duration. Fill it with uncertainties, rumors, leads to follow, reminders,
to-dos, etc. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Talk to your project sponsor. Write down what <em>you</em> think they&rsquo;re hoping to
achieve. Write down what they&rsquo;re telling you and double-check that you got it
right. Clear up any confusion about what you&rsquo;re role will be and who you should
bring project updates to. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Your junior engineers are looking for safety and stability. Find one person who
you can be open and unsure with, e.g., your manager, a mentor, or staff engineer
peers. Be that person for others too. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Don&rsquo;t waste the brief period where it&rsquo;s cognitively cheap to not know. Take any
step that helps you exert control over the problem: talk to someone; draw a
picture. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Use your strengths. If more comfortable with code, jump in. If you tend to go
first to relationships, talk to people. If you&rsquo;re a reader, go to the docs.
Start convincing your brain that this is just another project. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=building-context>Building Context</h3><p>Out of all the possible business goals, the technical investments, and the
pending tasks, why is <em>this</em> the one that&rsquo;s happening? If the project you&rsquo;ve
been asked to lead won&rsquo;t achieve the goal, then reject the premise of the
project. Better to find out early. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>It&rsquo;s not easy to understand what your users actually want &ndash; as opposed to what
they&rsquo;re telling you. Ask a user to let you shadow them using the software you&rsquo;re
replacing. Ask internal users to describe the API they wish they had. If you
have UX researchers studying the customer experience, read their work, talk to
them, observe some user interviews. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Make sure that your sponsor and any other leads on the project agree on the
success metrics. Will it mean more revenue from users, fewer outages, a process
that takes less time? Treat your own ideas with the most skepticism and get
real, measurable goals in place quickly. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Understand the constraints, e.g., deadlines that can&rsquo;t be moved, teams that you
depend on that might be too busy to help, etc. Set your own expectations and
other people&rsquo;s too. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Be clear about your areas of uncertainty. What could prevent you from meeting
the deadline? What don&rsquo;t you know, and what approaches can you take to make
those less ambiguous? Make frequent iterative changes so you have a better
chance of getting user feedback and course-correcting. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Respect what came before. Where did the idea for the project come from? Have
teams tried and failed to solve the problem &ndash; how to engage their enthusiasm
again? Are there existing users with odd use cases that will still need support?
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Know key people that you should talk regularly with. On a bigger project with
many teams, you&rsquo;ll need a contact person on each team. Understand who the
leaders are and what role they&rsquo;re expected to play lest you waste time in power
struggles. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=giving-your-project-structure>Giving Your Project Structure</h3><p>Define leadership responsibilities, e.g., understanding customer needs and
providing initial requirements, providing KPIs for product success, setting
timelines, setting scope and milestones, managing team members' performance and
growth, mentoring and coaching on technical topics, designing high-level
architecture, communicating status to stakeholders, devising A/B experiments,
making final decisions on technical approach, making final decision on
user-visible behavior. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Having a process for making decisions helps prevent two common failure modes:
never making a decision because it&rsquo;s not clear who the decider is, and
re-litigating every decision over and over. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>As a project lead, you&rsquo;re implicitly filling any roles that don&rsquo;t already have
someone in them. If no one&rsquo;s tracking user requirements, that&rsquo;s you. If nobody
is project managing, that&rsquo;s you as well. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Recruit people for unfulfilled roles that you don&rsquo;t want to do or don&rsquo;t have
time to do. Look for people with complementary skills, e.g., if you&rsquo;re a big
picture person, look for someone who loves getting into the details. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>Other than having worked with folks in the past, how do I take stock of the
skills that are available in the team, and find people with the missing skills?</p></div></div><p>Agree on scope. Deliver incremental value, and be prepared for each incremental
change to potentially change the user requirements for the next one. Changing
what your users <em>can</em> do helps them realize what else they <em>want</em> to do. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Make the increments small enough that there&rsquo;s always a reachable milestone in
sight. Place a date on that milestone so that folks act with a sense of urgency.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>If the project is big enough, split the work into work-streams, chunks of
functionality that can be created in parallel, perhaps with different sub-teams,
each with its own set of milestones. This lets you talk about any one of them
independently from the others. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Time estimates are hard. Update your schedules as you gain experience with the
problem. Practice estimating even when it doesn&rsquo;t matter and see if more of your
estimates are right over time. When estimating, figure out the availability of
teams that you depend on too. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Agree on logistics. How often are meetings, demos, retrospectives, etc.? How
will you encourage informal communication? How and when will you share status
with the project sponsor? Where will the documentation home be? What will the
development process be, e.g., standards for code review? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>While all of the important information is written down already, having a kickoff
meeting helps start a project with momentum. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Reilly2022Ch5>The Staff Engineer's Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change<i>.</i>
