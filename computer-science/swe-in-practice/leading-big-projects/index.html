boundaries of technology, it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re dealing with ambiguity: unclear
direction; messy, complicated humans; or legacy systems with behavior you can&rsquo;t
predict. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>As a tech lead, the folks working on the project may not be reporting to you,
but you&rsquo;re responsible for the result. You&rsquo;re thinking about the whole problem,
including parts of it that aren&rsquo;t really anyone&rsquo;s job. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h2 id=the-start-of-a-project>The Start of a Project</h2><h3 id=if-youre-feeling-overwhelmed>If You&rsquo;re Feeling Overwhelmed&mldr;</h3><p>It takes time and energy to build the mental maps that let you navigate it all.
The difficulty is the point. Ambiguity is the nature of the work &ndash; if it wasn&rsquo;t
messy and difficult, they wouldn&rsquo;t need you. You got to the lead role with
credibility and social capital &ndash; ten mistakes will not destroy you. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Create a document to act as an external part of your brain for the project&rsquo;s
duration. Fill it with uncertainties, rumors, leads to follow, reminders,
to-dos, etc. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Talk to your project sponsor. Write down what <em>you</em> think they&rsquo;re hoping to
achieve. Write down what they&rsquo;re telling you and double-check that you got it
right. Clear up any confusion about what you&rsquo;re role will be and who you should
bring project updates to. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Your junior engineers are looking for safety and stability. Find one person who
you can be open and unsure with, e.g., your manager, a mentor, or staff engineer
peers. Be that person for others too. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Don&rsquo;t waste the brief period where it&rsquo;s cognitively cheap to not know. Take any
step that helps you exert control over the problem: talk to someone; draw a
picture. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Use your strengths. If more comfortable with code, jump in. If you tend to go
first to relationships, talk to people. If you&rsquo;re a reader, go to the docs.
Start convincing your brain that this is just another project. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=building-context>Building Context</h3><p>Out of all the possible business goals, the technical investments, and the
pending tasks, why is <em>this</em> the one that&rsquo;s happening? If the project you&rsquo;ve
been asked to lead won&rsquo;t achieve the goal, then reject the premise of the
project. Better to find out early. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>It&rsquo;s not easy to understand what your users actually want &ndash; as opposed to what
they&rsquo;re telling you. Ask a user to let you shadow them using the software you&rsquo;re
replacing. Ask internal users to describe the API they wish they had. If you
have UX researchers studying the customer experience, read their work, talk to
them, observe some user interviews. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>This is a muscle that I don&rsquo;t yet have. The ratio of PMs to SWEs isn&rsquo;t that
high, and thus I&rsquo;ll need to don the PM hat in some projects. That said, the PM
world is as nuanced and rich as the SWE world. How do I not end up with two
full-time jobs?</p></div></div><p>Make sure that your sponsor and any other leads on the project agree on the
success metrics. Will it mean more revenue from users, fewer outages, a process
that takes less time? Treat your own ideas with the most skepticism and get
real, measurable goals in place quickly. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Understand the constraints, e.g., deadlines that can&rsquo;t be moved, teams that you
depend on that might be too busy to help, etc. Set your own expectations and
other people&rsquo;s too. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Be clear about your areas of uncertainty. What could prevent you from meeting
the deadline? What don&rsquo;t you know, and what approaches can you take to make
those less ambiguous? Make frequent iterative changes so you have a better
chance of getting user feedback and course-correcting. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Respect what came before. Where did the idea for the project come from? Have
teams tried and failed to solve the problem &ndash; how to engage their enthusiasm
again? Are there existing users with odd use cases that will still need support?
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Sometimes what came before was attempted by previous team members who have since
left the company. Steel-manning their approach should be more useful. For
example, it&rsquo;s not as if <em>my docs</em> are the ones that will be easily discoverable
in the future &ndash; where are the original docs and how could they be more visible?</p></div></div><p>Know key people that you should talk regularly with. On a bigger project with
many teams, you&rsquo;ll need a contact person on each team. Understand who the
leaders are and what role they&rsquo;re expected to play lest you waste time in power
struggles. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=giving-your-project-structure>Giving Your Project Structure</h3><p>Define leadership responsibilities, e.g., understanding customer needs and
providing initial requirements, providing KPIs for product success, setting
timelines, setting scope and milestones, managing team members' performance and
growth, mentoring and coaching on technical topics, designing high-level
architecture, communicating status to stakeholders, devising A/B experiments,
making final decisions on technical approach, making final decision on
user-visible behavior. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Having a process for making decisions helps prevent two common failure modes:
never making a decision because it&rsquo;s not clear who the decider is, and
re-litigating every decision over and over. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>As a project lead, you&rsquo;re implicitly filling any roles that don&rsquo;t already have
someone in them. If no one&rsquo;s tracking user requirements, that&rsquo;s you. If nobody
is project managing, that&rsquo;s you as well. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Recruit people for unfulfilled roles that you don&rsquo;t want to do or don&rsquo;t have
time to do. Look for people with complementary skills, e.g., if you&rsquo;re a big
picture person, look for someone who loves getting into the details. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>Other than having worked with folks in the past, how do I take stock of the
skills that are available in the team, and find people with the missing skills?</p></div></div><p>Agree on scope. Deliver incremental value, and be prepared for each incremental
change to potentially change the user requirements for the next one. Changing
what your users <em>can</em> do helps them realize what else they <em>want</em> to do. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Make the increments small enough that there&rsquo;s always a reachable milestone in
sight. Place a date on that milestone so that folks act with a sense of urgency.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>It seems that by definition, deadlines should not be aspirational. Need a better
visual on how realistic a given date is. I&rsquo;d like to have timely delivery
without inducing stress for the sake of a date.</p></div></div><p>If the project is big enough, split the work into work-streams, chunks of
functionality that can be created in parallel, perhaps with different sub-teams,
each with its own set of milestones. This lets you talk about any one of them
independently from the others. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Time estimates are hard. Update your schedules as you gain experience with the
problem. Practice estimating even when it doesn&rsquo;t matter and see if more of your
estimates are right over time. When estimating, figure out the availability of
teams that you depend on too. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Agree on logistics. How often are meetings, demos, retrospectives, etc.? How
will you encourage informal communication? How and when will you share status
with the project sponsor? Where will the documentation home be? What will the
development process be, e.g., standards for code review? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>While all of the important information is written down already, having a kickoff
meeting helps start a project with momentum. Be explicit about what you want
people to do. If you&rsquo;re ambiguous, then you&rsquo;re making more work for everyone
else as they try to figure out how much the thing you&rsquo;ve asked for matters. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h2 id=driving-the-project>Driving the Project</h2><h3 id=exploring>Exploring</h3><p>Understand the project&rsquo;s goals and evaluate the approaches. If it&rsquo;s difficult to
articulate the goals, or the goals are a description of your implementation,
then spend more time exploring. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Different teams have different mental models of the project, e.g., they think
your project will also achieve some other goal they care about. Be able to
concisely and accurately explain what different teams want. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Sum up the project and reduce it to its most important aspects. Build up a clear
description of what you&rsquo;re not doing. On related projects, how do they overlap?
Is there work that seems familiar but isn&rsquo;t actually related? Is there work that
seems unrelated but has unexpected connections? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Don&rsquo;t cling tightly to your original ideas, resisting all information that
contradicts that worldview. Existing work might not match your vision, but be
receptive to the idea that it might be workable, and one less thing to maintain
going forward. Understand whether similar projects have succeeded or failed, and
where they struggled. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This might take the form of defining the goal in terms of the implementation.
When that&rsquo;s the case, dropping the implementation might feel as if you&rsquo;re
declaring defeat.</p></div></div><h3 id=clarifying>Clarifying</h3><p>Unlike folks chipping in, you&rsquo;re incentivized to grok the tricky concepts. Take
the time to reduce the complexity for them lest they optimize for the wrong
outcome. How can you hook the concepts onto their existing knowledge? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Take time to understand what words are meaningful to the people you intend to
communicate with. Use their words when you can, or deliberately describe what
<em>you</em> mean by the terms you&rsquo;re using. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Visual representations help reduce complexity. If something&rsquo;s changing, use
&ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; pictures. If showing progress towards a goal, can you use a
graph? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=designing>Designing</h3><p>No objections when you talk about ideas for what comes next could be a result of
your colleagues not having internalized the plan. Write things down to ensure
everyone is aligned. Include the important aspects of the plan so that others
can spot hazards in the path. Agree on whether your assumptions on other teams
or systems are correct. A written design is very cheap iteration. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>A Request for Comments (RFC) document is helpful at this stage. Most companies
have an RFC template. Heroes need not improvise; a good template helps us avoid
common mistakes and make the right decisions intentionally. An RFC should:</p><ul><li>Anchor in space and time. If read in 2 years, can the reader decide its
relevance from the header? What&rsquo;s the status, e.g., early idea, implemented,
on hold, etc.</li><li>Show what problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve. Provide enough information for
readers to decide if they think you&rsquo;re solving the right problem. The specific
implementation should serve the goal; it should not be the goal.</li><li>Lay out how you intend to achieve the goal. Provide enough information for
readers to evaluate whether the solution will work, e.g., APIs, pseudo-code,
architectural diagrams. Wrong or controversial is better than vague.</li><li>Consider security, privacy, and compliance. Be explicit if you think no
considerations are needed.</li><li>Describe alternatives and prior art. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they work? If some other
team has a related solution, send the RFC to them and collect their input.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Watch out for these technical pitfalls:</p><ul><li>Assuming it&rsquo;s a brand new problem. It&rsquo;s rarely the case. Learn from other
people; consider reusing existing solutions.</li><li>If another domain seems easy, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve not internalized that it&rsquo;s
as rich and nuanced and complex as your own.</li><li>Will your solution still work in 3 years? Will it become a bottleneck for
other teams?</li><li>&ldquo;We might need it later&rdquo; as a justification. Explain why designing for a few
orders of magnitude more than current usage is a good investment right now.</li><li>Any part of the solution that involves humans changing their workflows will be
difficult.</li><li>Figuring out the difficult part later might turn out infeasible or push the
complexity to someone else (e.g., API breakages instead of backward
compatibility).</li><li>Solving the small problem by making the big problem less tractable. Either
engage with the difficult problem directly, or call out the tradeoff in the
design.</li><li>Thinking it&rsquo;s not a rewrite, but in practice it is, e.g., re-architecting for
the cloud. It&rsquo;s going to take much longer.</li><li>Make processes as boring and self-documenting as possible. If you struggle at
3pm, you won&rsquo;t understand it at 3am.</li><li>Bike-shedding. Don&rsquo;t spend time deliberating trivial and reversible decisions.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=coding>Coding</h3><p>Most project leads review a lot of code, but don&rsquo;t write much themselves.
Writing code is rarely the highest leverage thing you can spend your time on.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Your time will be the least predictable. Don&rsquo;t work on code that is
time-sensitive or on the critical path. Aim for your code to empower your team,
not to take over from them. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Find opportunities for other people to grow, especially on the important
changes. Provide an opinion or two. Pair-program for key parts of the change and
leave the colleague to complete the work. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>If there are implementation constraints that you&rsquo;d rather not compromise on,
specify them in the work item. The constraints should be the goal, and the
implementation should be in service of that goal. For example, &ldquo;The search
module should be extensible to support filtering as well. An implementation
could be&mldr;&rdquo;. In this case, I provide my opinions why still giving the
implementor room to be creative about it. The implementation suggestion serves
as a clarifying exposition and not a prescription.</p></div></div><p>Let the rest of the team think of you as a resource to learn from, not someone
who criticizes every decision and makes them feel inadequate. Let someone set a
pattern that&rsquo;s good enough without overruling them. Don&rsquo;t be the one doing all
the code reviews lest you be a single point of failure without the team learning
as much. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><p>Whatever you do sets expectations for the team. Meet/exceed testing standards,
add useful comments, and be careful about taking shortcuts. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Had a successful work project with regard to shipping well tested code. By
figuring out how to structure my tests, other devs followed the patterns I
established. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not that folks don&rsquo;t want to do something like
testing, but more that the testing approach itself is ambiguous, and having a
trodden path makes it easier to add the next set of tests.</p></div></div><h3 id=communicating>Communicating</h3><p>Make it easy for team members to reach out and ask questions, and disagree
without it getting tense. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Having a &ldquo;water-cooler&rdquo; long-lived chat seems to help. Takes the pressure out
of needing to have polished questions. Some folks are also more comfortable
asking questions in smaller group settings. That said, smaller group chats can
lead to information silos where techniques are unnecessarily re-derived from
first principles :-/</p></div></div><p>Make it easy for sponsors and customers to find out the status. Too much detail
can obscure the message. Explain the status in terms of what the audience will
want to know, e.g., what can users do right now, and not that you stood up three
micro-services. Lead with the headlines. Follow facts with &ldquo;that means&mldr;&rdquo; or
&ldquo;so that we can&mldr;&rdquo; Avoid being a watermelon project; if the project is stuck,
don&rsquo;t hide it: ask for help. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h3 id=navigating>Navigating</h3><p>Assume that something is going to go wrong &ndash; you just don&rsquo;t know yet what it&rsquo;ll
be. You&rsquo;re responsible for re-routing, escalating to someone who can help, or
breaking the news that the goal is now unreachable. Communicate well; don&rsquo;t
create panic or let rumors start. Your sponsor wants your project to succeed;
telling them you need help gives them a chance to do their jobs. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch5></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Reilly2022Ch5>The Staff Engineer's Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change<i>.</i>
