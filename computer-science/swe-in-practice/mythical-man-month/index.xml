The Programming Systems Product How do 2 programmers in a remodeled garage build an important program that surpasses the best efforts of large teams?
A Program Garage duos typically build a program: complete in itself, ready to be run by the author on the system on which it was developed.</description></item><item><title>Mythical Man Month [Brooks, Jr., Frederick P]</title><link>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/swe-in-practice/mythical-man-month/_meta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 1974 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/swe-in-practice/mythical-man-month/_meta/</guid><description/></item><item><title>02.

Why is this cause of disaster so common? Our estimation techniques assume that all will go well, i.e. each task will take only as long as it &amp;ldquo;ought&amp;rdquo; to take. Our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are interchangeable. Because we are uncertain of our estimates, software managers often lack the courteous stubbornness - if you&amp;rsquo;re made to wait, it is to serve you better, and to please you.</description></item><item><title>03.

Sackman et. al. found 10:1 ratios. The data showed no correlation between experience and performance.
The idea of a 10x developer is mostly ridiculed in my online circles. That said, some jobs have X years of experience as a requirement. How can we resolve these contradictions?
The major part of the cost of large teams is communication, and system debugging to correct the ill effects of miscommunication.</description></item></channel></rss>
