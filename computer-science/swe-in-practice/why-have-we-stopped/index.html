I (or my team) is the blocker.</p></div></div><h3 id=blocked-by-another-team>Blocked By Another Team</h3><p><strong>Understand and explain.</strong> Why is the work is important? What do you want from
them and by when? Give them another chance to indicate feasibility and/or
alternatives. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make the work easier.</strong> Can you ask for a smaller subset of features? Can you
help unblock their dependencies. Note that supporting your foray into their code
base might cost them more in support and they might decline your offer. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Get organizational support.</strong> If priorities are unclear, ask your leadership
to adjudicate on relative priorities. If your leaders agree, consult with
project sponsor on how to politely escalate to a mutual leader. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make alternative plans.</strong> Rescope the project; choose a different direction;
push the shipping date. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=blocked-by-a-decision>Blocked By a Decision</h3><p><strong>Understand and explain.</strong> Get the information or approval they need to make a
decision. Explain what can&rsquo;t happen until and unless they decide &ndash; use impact
on things <em>they</em> care about. If they&rsquo;re blocked, understand who/what they&rsquo;re
waiting for. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make the work easier.</strong> If their decision is blocked by conflict, play
mediator to find a solution that suits both. If blocked by <em>their</em> decision
makers, give information in the format they need to take back. Explain which
parts of the decision are important and expensive to reverse later. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I&rsquo;ve had cases where the two parties that need to have a conversation don&rsquo;t know
about each other. Introducing them to each other and then monitoring the email
thread has been low-effort but high-impact for me.</p></div></div><p><strong>Get organizational support.</strong> Talk to your project sponsor about what they&rsquo;d
like to do. Maybe they&rsquo;re in some rooms where they can push for a decision to
happen. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make alternative plans.</strong> Can make your best guess about the decision,
document it and its tradeoffs, and mitigate risks. Be realistic &ndash; are
workarounds enough or is the project infeasible? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=blocked-by-a-single-button-click>Blocked By a Single Button Click</h3><p><strong>Understand and explain.</strong> If you really need to skip the queue, politely ask.
If they go out of their way to help you, publicly recognize, e.g., peer bonus,
launch email credits, etc. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>How do you know if the wait time is atypical? Some teams publish SLAs for
requests, but that might not be representative.</p><p>On the receiving end, I can try to make the queue and its &ldquo;processing time&rdquo;
observable. For example, all PRs that need my team&rsquo;s attention should have the
same assigned reviewer, such that the list of PRs assigned to that reviewer
group becomes the observable queue.</p></div></div><p><strong>Make the work easier.</strong> Structure your ticket to be one of the easy ones,
e.g., as small as possible; succinctly include all relevant information, etc.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>If it&rsquo;s a sign-off on a PR, what kinds of issues have they raised in similar
PRs? Are those addressed in yours? Some teams have reviewer bots that automate
common issues &ndash; have all automated suggestions been considered?</p></div></div><p><strong>Get organizational support.</strong> Escalating to skip the line is thorny; mitigate
by being explicit about the importance of the team&rsquo;s process, and why you&rsquo;re
requesting to circumvent it just this once. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make alternative plans.</strong> Connecting with someone on the team is usually
enough to raise priority, but if nothing works, notify stakeholders that
there&rsquo;ll be a delay. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>That someone on the team can feel singled out, especially when you pick them for
having reviewed other requests in the recent past. Sometimes they&rsquo;ve redirected
me back to the group, implying that there is a queue and a process of doing
things.</p></div></div><h3 id=blocked-by-a-single-person>Blocked By a Single Person</h3><p><strong>Understand and explain.</strong> Be clear about the request&rsquo;s importance, especially
when waiting on a senior colleague who is making deliberate judgments about
relative importance. Give them a chance to revise their availability; set a
go/no-go deadline to start finding alternative approaches. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make the work easier.</strong> Add structure; break the problem down. Consider the
&ldquo;three bullet points and a call to action&rdquo; technique. If the colleague is
overwhelmed, reassure them that the request is legitimately difficult but
learnable. Help them, but don&rsquo;t take over lest they not learn. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Get organizational support.</strong> If they&rsquo;re the reason a project is going to
fail, you&rsquo;re not doing your job if you ignore it. Escalating means asking for
help, e.g., talking to the manager might be the only way to adjust priorities.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>How to communicate intent to escalate? Tricky to do this right. As an IC, I
don&rsquo;t like someone escalating to my manager because it feels like I&rsquo;m not doing
my job. But if the recommendation comes from me, then I feel more at peace with
it, e.g., your feature is not a top priority for my team; to change that, please
raise this with my manager.</p></div></div><h3 id=blocked-by-necessary-but-unowned-work>Blocked By Necessary But Unowned Work</h3><p><strong>Understand and explain.</strong> Interpret the information gleaned from various
conversations, and write down conclusions in a rollup document. Perhaps Alex
says, &ldquo;The new library will give us authentication for this end point,&rdquo; and
later Meena tells you, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t upgrade to the new library till Q3&rdquo;. In the
rollup document, explicitly state, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have authentication until at least
Q3&rdquo;. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make the work easier.</strong> If you have time to mentor, advise, or join the team,
mention that in the rollup. Leadership might be more inclined to build a team
around an existing volunteer. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Get organizational support.</strong> Your highest-value work for this is advocating
for organizational support and an owning team. Hone the elevator pitch for why
the problem is worth your organization&rsquo;s time &ndash; your sponsor needs to justify
this to their peers. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make alternative plans.</strong> If you can&rsquo;t get a commitment for anyone to own the
work, then your project isn&rsquo;t high priority and should be postponed. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=blocked-by-a-huge-crowd-of-people>Blocked By a Huge Crowd of People</h3><p><strong>Understand and explain.</strong> Re-affirm the narrative of a migration as it can get
lost, e.g., &ldquo;that infrastructure team just wants to play with new technology.&rdquo;
Understand both sides and help tell both stories. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>And the strongest version of both stories. I&rsquo;ve encountered instances where the
one side was caricatured to the point where the other side&rsquo;s solution seemed
like the <em>only</em> thing that should have been done. That&rsquo;s not in line with the
&ldquo;respect what came before&rdquo; mantra.</p></div></div><p><strong>Make the work easier.</strong> The team pushing for the migration should do as much
extra work as possible, e.g., automating steps; being specific and explicit
about what other teams need to do; minimal gotchas in the new system; make the
new way the default for new projects. Show the progress of the work as people
tend to be eager to do their part to get the numbers down. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Get organizational support.</strong> If you can&rsquo;t convince your leadership that the
migration should be reflected in the organization&rsquo;s quarterly goals, then this
is not where you should be spending time right now. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Fine, the migration is important in my organization. How can I make it important
in theirs? Is it a matter of my sponsor getting their organization to adopt it
too?</p></div></div><p><strong>Make alternative plans.</strong> With organizational mandate, can you withdraw
support for the old way? Can the remaining teams be the sole supporters of the
old system? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h2 id=youre-lost>You&rsquo;re Lost</h2><h3 id=you-dont-know-where-youre-all-going>You Don&rsquo;t Know Where You&rsquo;re All Going</h3><p>Usually happens when everyone agrees that <em>something</em> should be done, but they
can&rsquo;t align on what, e.g., an organizational goal to &ldquo;modernize the
architecture&rdquo;. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Clarify roles.</strong> Be explicit that you want to hear from everyone, but that
you&rsquo;re not aiming for complete agreement. Ask your project sponsor to back you
up in being the decider. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Choose a strategy.</strong> Until all agree on exactly what problem you&rsquo;re solving,
then no one is allowed to discuss implementation details. Any strategy will, by
definition, make tradeoffs. Some real problems will remain unsolved for now. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Choose a problem.</strong> If you can&rsquo;t rank all available problems, choose
<em>something</em>, any real problem, and set expectations that the group should not be
diverted by the other (very real) issues. Wrong is better than vague; deliberate
action is better than staying frozen in indecision. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>A document seems apt for acknowledging other real problems, and why you didn&rsquo;t
choose them as the immediate problems to solve.</p></div></div><p><strong>Choose a stakeholder.</strong> Reorient the project around getting <em>something</em> to
<em>someone</em> (solving a vertical slice). Progressing in <em>some</em> direction can help
break the deadlock and clarify next steps. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=you-dont-know-how-to-get-there>You Don&rsquo;t Know How to Get There</h3><p><strong>Articulate the problem.</strong> Notice places where you could be more precise about
who/what you&rsquo;re referring to or what <em>is</em> happening versus what <em>should</em> be
happening. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Revisit your assumptions.</strong> Instead of aiming for an improvement on every
axis, are there acceptable tradeoffs? Have you already assumed a specific
solution? Can you specify the precise problem to be solved independently of the
methods used in the solution? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Design docs are encouraged to have at least one other plausible solution. Helps
with not being tunnel-visioned.</p></div></div><p><strong>Give it time.</strong> Take a few days away from the problem. Even if you haven&rsquo;t
thought about it in the meantime, chances are that you&rsquo;ll come back with better
ideas. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Psychology refers to the unconscious processing of problems as <strong>incubation.</strong>
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#IncubationWiki></a></span></p></div></div><p><strong>Look for prior art.</strong> Unlikely that you&rsquo;re the first person to ever solve a
problem like this. Other industries have well-thought-out solutions to problems
tech people think we&rsquo;re discovering for the first time! <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Having taken Electrical Engineering during my first 3 years of undergrad, I was
familiar with debouncing from a circuit perspective. Imagine my surprise to find
it in UI development.</p></div></div><p><strong>Learn from other people.</strong> Most technical domains have active internet
communities. Spend time there absorbing how they think and what keywords and
solutions they mention that you don&rsquo;t know about. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Try a different angle.</strong> Maybe an organizational solution to solve a technical
problem and vice-versa? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Start smaller.</strong> Try solving one single small part and see if the sense of
progress makes the rest of the work feel more achievable. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Ask for help.</strong> If hesitant, remember that by learning from other people&rsquo;s
experiences, you&rsquo;re amortizing the time they had to spend learning the same
thing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=you-dont-know-where-you-stand>You Don&rsquo;t Know Where You Stand</h3><p>New initiative from the latest all-hands that could derail yours? Missing on the
list of the organization&rsquo;s important projects? Sponsor checking in less often?
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Clarify organizational support.</strong> Explain what you&rsquo;ve heard to your project
sponsor and ask whether your project is intended to continue. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Clarify roles.</strong> Running a project as an &ldquo;unofficial lead&rdquo; is an invitation to
fail &ndash; if you&rsquo;re the lead and nobody else knows you are, you&rsquo;re not the lead.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Ask for what you need.</strong> Mention of the project at an all-hands meeting? Being
listed on the organization&rsquo;s goals? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Refuel.</strong> Setting new deadlines; building a new charter; phase 2 of the
project. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h2 id=you-have-arrived-somewhere>You Have Arrived&mldr; Somewhere?</h2><h3 id=but-its-code-complete>But It&rsquo;s Code Complete!</h3><p>The software being ready isn&rsquo;t enough. Nobody wants to use software; they want
to catch a Pokémon. Deploying and monitoring; getting launch approval; updating
docs; making it usable. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Define &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</strong> Let intended users of a new feature try out the tasks they&rsquo;ll
want to do with it, and agree that those features are working well. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Scale invariant. Even for granular tasks, define the exit criteria for clarity.
This is especially useful when others audit the completion without you being
present to clarify things.</p></div></div><p><strong>Be your own user.</strong> Take time to share your customers' experience. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Celebrate landings, not launches.</strong> Celebrate shipping things to users. If
doing a migration, celebrate the old thing being turned off, not the new thing
that got launched. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=its-done-but-nobody-is-using-it>It&rsquo;s Done But Nobody Is Using It</h3><p><strong>Tell people.</strong> You need to <em>keep</em> telling them. Send emails, do road shows,
get a slot at the all-hands, offer white-glove service to strategic customers.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make it discoverable.</strong> A search on any documentation platforms should end up
at the right place. Create a memorable short-link. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=its-built-on-a-shaky-foundation>It&rsquo;s Built On a Shaky Foundation</h3><p>In a competitive market, launching <em>something</em> is often more important than that
something to be solid. Beware that if you don&rsquo;t have something in good shape by
the end of the project, it&rsquo;ll take extraordinary effort to clean it up later.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Set a culture of quality.</strong> Be the reviewer who always asks for tests,
monitoring, and documentation updates. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Make the foundational work a user story.</strong> Can frame cleanup work as part of
the user experience (e.g., reliability of the feature), or laying the foundation
for the next feature. Focus the conversation on customer&rsquo;s needs. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>Negotiate for engineer-led time.</strong> Sometimes called &ldquo;tech debt weeks&rdquo;. The
point is that it&rsquo;s a dedicated time to do work that everyone in engineering
knows is necessary. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h3 id=the-project-just-stops-here>The Project Just Stops Here</h3><p><strong>Declare &ldquo;done enough&rdquo;.</strong> Further investment is not worth the cost. Watch out
for abandoning unhappy customers, bailing once technical work is done, or
walking away from a half-migration.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s not the right journey to take.</strong> Sometimes you can&rsquo;t discover that a
solution won&rsquo;t work without exploring it. Pushing on anyway would be a failure.
Write a retrospective and share as much as you can about what happened. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>The project has been cancelled.</strong> Try to understand the bigger picture and get
as much perspective. Talk to your team, leading with the why &ndash; it&rsquo;s important
they hear directly from you. Showcase everyone&rsquo;s work lest it (unfairly) derails
promotions or great performance ratings. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><p><strong>This is the destination!</strong> Mark the occasion and make the success feel
special, e.g., parties, time off, shout-outs, presentations, etc. Consider a
retrospective &ndash; you can learn just as much from things that went right.
Highlight aspects of your culture that you want to enforce, e.g., communicating
well. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch6></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Reilly2022Ch6>The Staff Engineer's Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change<i>.</i>
