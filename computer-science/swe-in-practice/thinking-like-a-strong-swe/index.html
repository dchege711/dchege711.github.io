the time in the world. Some examples of capabilities:</p><ul><li>Solving very difficult bugs, e.g., race conditions across multiple services.</li><li>Delivering meaningful improvements to the thorniest parts of legacy codebases.</li><li>Making changes that require a big architectural rework.</li></ul><p>At the top end of strongest engineers, capabilities become something like
&ldquo;improving the SOTA for LLMs&rdquo;. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024></a></span></p><p>Regular engineers make the bulk of most companies. They solve 95% of bugs
(normal, non-cursed bugs), deliver most JIRA tickets, and unstick themselves
from dev env issues most of the time. They <em>help</em>. They <em>do the work</em>. They&rsquo;re
just not burning with ambition to excel at the next promo cycle. Probably have
other things going on in their lives. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024></a></span></p><p>Weak engineers are more likely at senior levels. The bar to hire juniors is
explicitly capabilities-based and harder to slip by; seniors can talk about work
they were tangentially involved with. A weak senior has to conceal their lack of
knowledge and needs to learn in secret, which is much harder. They survive by
reaching out in DMs to other team members. People can be weak for all kinds of
personal reasons that are none of your business. That said, avoid
time-asymmetrical helping &ndash; don&rsquo;t let them spend minutes of their day tying up
hours of yours. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024></a></span></p><h2 id=what-makes-strong-engineers-strong>What Makes Strong Engineers Strong?</h2><p>Strong engineers need raw confidence to believe that they&rsquo;ll figure it out, or
the problem is too fiendish that there&rsquo;s no shame in failing to solve it. Tackle
the hardest part head-on instead of putting it off or trying to work around it.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025></a></span></p><p>Strong engineers are ruthless pragmatists that judge design decisions by how
well it will work, not how clean or elegant a solution is. They often come into
conflict with smart, technically capable, weak engineers, e.g., &ldquo;is this design
pattern overkill for our use case&rdquo;. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025></a></span></p><p>Strong engineers work fast. Fast execution: (1) lets you experiment rapidly
enough to find the right solution; (2) makes low-chance-but-high-reward ideas
worth trying and eventually producing high reward; (3) make whole different
tasks possible. It&rsquo;s usually short intense bursts of productivity separated by
long periods of relative inactivity. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>See
<a href=https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Some reasons to work on productivity and
velocity
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>by Dan Luu. Referenced by
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025></a></span>.</p></div></div><p>Deeply technical people will see simple solutions that others miss, and will be
able to solve who categories of problems that other&rsquo;s cant. The technical
strengths needed should match the work that needs doing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025></a></span>Tracing lifetimes and crashes were a good fit for me working in the C++
Chromium codebase; my manager could (and did) throw hot reliability bugs my way.</p><h2 id=value-over-replacement>Value Over Replacement</h2><p>To measure value, estimate how much profit your specific part of the company is
making, and how much your code is contributing to that, e.g., if you unlock a
new customer segment bringing in ~5M/year in revenue, then your value is some
percentage of 5M/year. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03></a></span></p><p>Value over replacement requires guessing what other engineers wouldn&rsquo;t have done
in your place, e.g., digging through metrics to find performance issues. It&rsquo;s
easy to imagine that your replacement is a dud or very strong indeed. Another
signal is when you (or another engineer) are explicitly requested for a
particular project. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03></a></span></p><h2 id=strong-engineers-are-right-a-lot>Strong Engineers are Right, A Lot</h2><p>Strong engineers are right about concrete factual statements (e.g., endpoint X
has rate limit Y), concrete plans (e.g., can&rsquo;t add this check here, but it&rsquo;ll
work there), lots of small decisions when writing code that show up in their
code generally working and causing fewer bugs. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-02></a></span></p><p>Never making confident technical statements is a dereliction of duty. If you&rsquo;re
the most technical in a room, it&rsquo;s your job to give information and advice. The
goal is to &ldquo;be right a lot&rdquo;, not &ldquo;never be wrong&rdquo;. Being wrong is forgivable,
particularly when you&rsquo;re the only one stepping forward to offer an answer or a
plan. Do a high volume of work in a single area for a long time, so you gain
deep familiarity and be right (a lot). <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I&rsquo;ve been wrong a fair number of times. What was most encouraging was seeing
other more senior engineers being wrong in public as well; if they are fallible,
then who am I not to try?</p><p>The times that I&rsquo;ve been painfully wrong was when I tried making a call despite
not being the person with the most context. In those cases, I was speaking out
of turn.</p></div></div><h2 id=strong-engineers-take-positions>Strong Engineers Take Positions</h2><p>When you&rsquo;re the person in the room with the most context (or technical skill),
you need to take a position. Otherwise, you force people with less technical
context than you figure it out themselves. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-02-10></a></span></p><p>Overusing caveats and qualifiers make managers think &ldquo;Ugh, why are you forcing
me to make the decision myself?&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m glad this person is being so
careful and accurate&rdquo;. Their job involves a lot of educated guesses and have
internalized that some guesses don&rsquo;t pan out. Going in the wrong direction will
at least often give you information, or provide a base to iterate on. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-02-10></a></span></p><p>In low-trust cultures, avoiding commitment is smart. Where trust between
engineering and product breaks down, engineers avoid giving estimates because
they face unfair consequences when those estimates aren&rsquo;t met. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-02-10></a></span></p><h2 id=software-engineering-under-the-spotlight>Software Engineering Under the Spotlight</h2><p>&ldquo;Focus&rdquo; means &ldquo;the CEO is actively supervising this&rdquo;, e.g., CEO asking for daily
updates, blockers are removed by force, agile ceremonies are abbreviated, etc.
Projects you&rsquo;ve done under a spotlight are 5-10x more impactful in promotion
packets; screwing up can stain your reputation permanently. Make your baseline
80% so that you can flex up to 120% for short periods when the spotlight is on
you. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-04-12></a></span></p><p>Chasing the spotlight is a good way to get promoted, but has its drawbacks,
e.g., always at 120%, constant transferring and context-switching, difficult to
build long-term colleague relationships, high pay but still substantially less
than the bonuses you&rsquo;re securing for the VPs. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-04-12></a></span></p><p>Some engineers hide from the spotlight. They get intrinsic motivation out of
writing code. They don&rsquo;t want to push for more power or influence and are not
terrified of being sidelined or laid off. Nothing wrong with this, but beware
the tradeoff: one month grinding in the spotlight is worth one year of grinding
in the dark. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-04-12></a></span></p><h2 id=why-some-engineers-get-trusted-with-high-impact-work>Why Some Engineers Get Trusted with High-Impact Work</h2><p>There are concentric circles of trust. Being the go-to engineer on your team
requires being straightforwardly good at your job. Your manager will steer
important work your way. Being the go-to engineer in your org has your manager&rsquo;s
peers asking your manager to task you with key pieces of work; your org leader
knows your name and occasionally reaches out. Finally, in the inner circle of
engineers at your company, all engineering-facing directors and VPs know your
name and you&rsquo;re shuffled to whatever the company considers important at any
given time. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-12-22></a></span></p><p>To move up the circles, you need invites each step of the way. You get contact
with senior managers by working on important projects, which (if you do a good
job) encourages them to tap you for more important projects. It boils down to:
what does it take to be the kind of engineer the company can trust? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-12-22></a></span></p><p>People higher in the management chain are heavily invested in success (bonuses,
not getting fired), but have less technical context and direct power to affect
the product. They&rsquo;re almost entirely dependent on their engineers to actually do
the work that needs doing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-12-22></a></span></p><p>Be discreet because they come to you with confidential information, e.g.,
company plans. When they ask you a question, draw out some sense of what the
agenda is before committing to a response; this is not the place to opine about
code quality. Get the technical questions right, e.g., don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s impossible
to do X and it turns out to be possible. If you break their trust, you&rsquo;ll be
silently and immediately dropped from that circle of trust. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-12-22></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Be vigilant about these cases. There have been times in my career when I&rsquo;ve been
called up, but was too busy to properly step up. I&rsquo;ve noticed that I didn&rsquo;t get
second invitations. It&rsquo;ll probably take even more effort to re-enter those
circles of trust.</p></div></div><p>Try to keep it inside your management chain. While it&rsquo;s pleasant to feel helpful,
these people won&rsquo;t be there during your performance review. You can push back
with something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to help. Let me run that request by my manager so
she knows what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-12-22></a></span></p><h2 id=how-to-choose-what-to-work-on>How to Choose What To Work On</h2><p>When the spotlight is on one of your team&rsquo;s projects, be willing to drop less
critical work and be fully engaged. Don&rsquo;t be knee-deep in other work when the
spotlight hits. The spotlight eventually moves on; important work is rare.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-03-01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Be light on your feet. The only time you should be at full capacity is when the
spotlight is on you.</p></div></div><p>Know when the spotlight is on. Visibly doing other things during an
all-hands-on-deck situation is much worse than doing nothing. You can make up
for a slow year by absolutely killing it during the right week. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-03-01></a></span></p><p>When the spotlight isn&rsquo;t on you, carve out your own lab days or 20% time. Spend
an afternoon on one of your own goals; if it doesn&rsquo;t provide value (doesn&rsquo;t
build credit with managers or fellow engineers), then the wasted time is on you.
The real value of lab days is regularly practicing the skill of choosing what
you work on. It takes time to learn which tasks will have a solid impact, and
which ones won&rsquo;t. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2024-03-01></a></span></p><h2 id=crushing-jira-tickets-is-a-party-trick>Crushing JIRA Tickets is a Party Trick</h2><p>Promotions, bonuses, and internal respect come from shipping projects, not from
closing tickets. Closing tickets is useful for rapid familiarity with the
codebase and credit with colleagues, but at some point, transition to
prioritizing work you think is the most important rather than whatever work is
in front of you. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-14></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The failure mode here is assuming the work in front of you is important. It
might have been important when it was created, but is it <em>still</em> important?</p></div></div><p>Importance at a tech company is whatever your C-staff say it is. Ruthlessly drop
work that is no longer important. If you ship a project and your management
chain begins talking about the next thing, stop improving that project. Declare
victory and walk away! <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-14></a></span></p><p>Figuring out what the most important thing is:</p><ul><li>Is there an ongoing high-visibility incident going on? Can I help with that?</li><li>Is there anyone waiting for a response from my team?</li><li>For each project that I&rsquo;m leading, in order of importance, what can I do to
help it ship right now?</li><li>For each project that my team is working on, in order of importance, is there
work available to be picked up that would move it along?</li><li>Are there any tickets on the JIRA board in &ldquo;ready for work&rdquo;?</li></ul><p>If you only spend your time on the most important thing, you can be hugely
impactful with much less than 40h of work per week. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-14></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This is where I want to be. I spent 2024-25 working the hardest in my career,
but on things that ultimately didn&rsquo;t matter to my management chain. I mustn&rsquo;t be
a JIRA ticket robot again.</p></div></div><p>Managers often trust their senior engineers when the engineers tell them that
technical work is important. They also communicate gently about priorities,
e.g., &ldquo;Sure, if you think this is worth doing then go ahead,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see the value in this work.&rdquo; Furthermore, company&rsquo;s stated values may be
at odds with their real values, e.g., manager can&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Actually, the company
doesn&rsquo;t care that much if our integration tests are flaky&rdquo; when the company is
doing a lot of messaging about the importance of integration tests. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-14></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Getting positive signals from your manager is key then. Seems like they&rsquo;ll be
silent when company&rsquo;s (or execs') stated values are in conflict with or don&rsquo;t
match their own.</p></div></div><p>Figuring out an important thing that your organization isn&rsquo;t doing and them
trying to convince them to do it is the hardest way to deliver value. You&rsquo;re
betting that your execs have done a bad job of identifying what they want &ndash;
that&rsquo;s a big risk, and even if you succeed at convincing them to let you look at
it, it&rsquo;s unlikely that it&rsquo;ll be top of their priority list. Worst case, you end
up deeply invested in a hard technical task that the company doesn&rsquo;t value. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-14></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>It&rsquo;s possible to be too early to a problem. I faced this when working in a
micro-services application.</p><p>The problem was &ldquo;get the <code>Foo</code> data present in the <code>Bar</code> service and persist in
the <code>Baz</code> service&rdquo;. Admittedly, this wasn&rsquo;t a feature that mattered <em>that much</em>.
However, I parsed the problem as an instance of &ldquo;<code>Foo</code>&rsquo;s serialization should
work for any two services&rdquo;. Wanting to solve this general case was enticing
because it was (1) technically challenging, e.g., services can be deployed
independently and the de-serialization should never break, and (2) could be
reused by multiple teams because <code>Foo</code> is a very common type in the code base.</p><p>However, my management chain didn&rsquo;t care about the general problem per-se.
Furthermore, code-owners outside my team doubted the need for a general
solution. In the end, I never shipped anything, and burnt capital with my
management chain.</p><p>3 months later, the org wants to solve the same problem, and the docs and PRs I
drafted are being used to guide that work. While validating to me, burning
capital wasn&rsquo;t worth it &ndash; my management chain still doesn&rsquo;t care about this
problem.</p></div></div><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Goedecke2024>What can strong engineers do that weak engineers can't?<i></i></cite>
