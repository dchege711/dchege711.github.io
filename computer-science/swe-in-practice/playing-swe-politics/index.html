and spent it on tech companies hoping for outsized returns. Companies desired to
attract and retain talent; &ldquo;literally anything&rdquo; is worth spending money on to
accumulate engineers. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03-16></a></span></p><p>In 2023, interest rates rose to ~5%. Tech companies now need to make money. If

addressable customer base by X%, (2) meets regulations needed to sell to large
enterprise customers, (3) avoids the company looking bad, or (4) is the right
thing to do. Some reasons are only important to companies when times are good.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03-01></a></span></p><p>In a large customer base worth ~250B, growing the base by 1% unlocks 2.5B and is
worthwhile if the team is costing the company less than 2.5B. In smaller
customer bases, the team&rsquo;s cost might be greater than the 1% growth, and the
company may not value such work. In short, anything not directly related to
profit survives in companies that are very profitable already, e.g., 1% growth
corresponds to 5B in revenue. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03-01></a></span></p><h2 id=protect-your-time-from-predators>Protect Your Time From Predators</h2><p>Helping people from other parts of the company feels good because it feels like
the cross-org impact that a staff+ engineer ought to have. However, helping
other parts of the org is not your main job. Delivering your projects is.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-19></a></span></p><p>Predators tend to send work via DMs instead of going through normal channels.
The work is uncompensated in that they&rsquo;re not in your reporting chain and won&rsquo;t
be there for you during performance review meetings. Another type of predator is
a weak engineer who draws on your help but (1) can&rsquo;t share credit, and (2)
aren&rsquo;t able to help you out later because they never acquire the relevant
skills. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-19></a></span></p><p>Distrust questions that are much easier to ask than to answer, e.g., &ldquo;I just
picked up this ticket and I&rsquo;m lost&rdquo; compared to &ldquo;I just picked up this ticket
and I&rsquo;ve tried [link to PR] but I don&rsquo;t like it for [reasons].&rdquo; Given a
low-effort question, give a low-effort answer. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-01-19></a></span></p><h2 id=in-defense-of-ruthless-managers>In Defense of Ruthless Managers</h2><p>Empathetic managers are emotionally invested in their employees as human beings.
Ruthless managers are there to communicate the company&rsquo;s needs to their
engineers and vice-versa. Empathetic managers are often in conflict with their
bosses, e.g., pushing back against tight deadlines, which leaves little capital
to push for things you need, e.g., promotions. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03-31></a></span></p><p>Ruthless managers are easier to predict because they do what their managers &ndash;
and the company &ndash; values. Empathetic managers have their own priorities, so it
is harder to know what behavior they&rsquo;ll reward. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Goedecke2025-03-31></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Goedecke2025-03-16>The good times in tech are over<i>.</i></cite>
