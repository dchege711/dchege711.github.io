someone thinks you&rsquo;re a good fit might mean it&rsquo;s similar to work you&rsquo;ve done
before and not an opportunity for growth.</li><li><strong>You ask to join.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s obvious that you&rsquo;re the best fit, don&rsquo;t wait
for someone else to notice.</li><li><strong>You have an idea.</strong> You need to convince others to care. Might get mired in
politics, but once it&rsquo;s underway, you have lots of control and can have huge
impact.</li><li><strong>The fire alarm goes off.</strong> Goals are usually very clear and there&rsquo;s a bias
to action. However, there are fewer opportunities for growth.</li><li><strong>You&rsquo;re invited to join a grassroots effort.</strong> Working groups can be
effective if there&rsquo;s organizational buy-in, a clear time commitment, exit
criteria, and a process for making decisions.</li><li><strong>Someone needs to&mldr;</strong> Volunteering can build credibility and goodwill, but
watch out for doing too much of it at the expense of other results people are
expecting from you.</li><li><strong>You&rsquo;re just meddling.</strong> Make sure you&rsquo;re not getting involved long enough to
cause chaos and then disengaging without sticking around to experience the
consequences of your changes.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><p>Don&rsquo;t be one of those people that always drop their own work to help with even a
minor outage, or respond to IMs within seconds, no matter what else you were
doing. Other people have limited access to your resource dashboard. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I feel like I built a lot of credibility helping others in Teams threads and
such, but at the expense of my own work. Need to minimize this, e.g., turning
off Teams until deliberate blocks, e.g., 11:30am (sometime before lunch) and
3:30pm (once I&rsquo;m mostly done with my core objectives).</p></div></div><h2 id=time>Time</h2><p>Time is your most finite resource. Everything that you commit to has an
opportunity cost. Put specific, deliberate non-meeting items on your calendar,
e.g., &ldquo;review proposal for authentication system&rdquo;. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>An automated mechanism for analyzing your days seems apt. For companies with
M365,
<a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/introduction target=_blank rel=noopener>Microsoft Viva
Insights
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>seems
like it&rsquo;d fit the bill. Will review my Viva Insights weekly, and see if there
are improvements that I can make to my workflow.</p></div></div><p>Don&rsquo;t allocate 100% of your time lest something unexpected happens and you
either need to drop something or run beyond capacity. You won&rsquo;t succeed unless
you can defend your time. The number of demands on it will increase and the
number of available hours will stay the same, so be deliberate about what you
prioritize. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Also need to defend my time for future me. My backlog currently has +150 items,
of which a sizable portion of them come from improvements that I think could be
worth it. Pruning that list every month or so should help. The moment I reach
for a separate list because my Azure Dev Ops list is intractable is a sign that
I&rsquo;m over-extending myself.</p><p>An alternate phrasing is lead time: time elapsed between the identification of
a requirement and its fulfillment. An ever-increasing backlog is a symptom of
saying &ldquo;Not Now&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;No&rdquo;. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#ScrumAlliance></a></span>Maybe asking myself
if something&rsquo;s worth waiting 3 months for, and if so, allowing it in my backlog.
I don&rsquo;t want a graveyard of unfulfilled promises.</p></div></div><h2 id=questions-to-ask-yourself-about-projects>Questions to Ask Yourself About Projects</h2><h3 id=energy>Energy</h3><p>The energy to stay focused on a piece of work and do something useful with it.
How many things are you currently doing? Does this kind of work give or take
energy? Is this fight worth it; what else could you be doing with that extra
energy? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=quality-of-life>Quality of Life</h3><p>We spend a lot of our lives at work, and you should want to feel good about it.
Every project needs core technical skills, project management, product
management, and people management. Do you want it intense and high stakes? Do
you prefer to work alone or collaborate? Do you like being on call? Are you open
to travel? Does it provide opportunities to share learnings, e.g., conference
talks? How do you feel about the project&rsquo;s goals? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=credibility>Credibility</h3><p>Do others think you&rsquo;re capable of doing whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do? You can
build credibility by solving hard problems, being visibly competent,
consistently showing good technical judgement (no absolutism), taking on a
chaotic situation and making it easier for everyone else to understand. Does the
project use your technical skills (implement something concrete or make it
tractable for others)? Does the project show your leadership skills (taking
responsibility for outcomes; communicating frequently and well; giving the right
level of detail around what&rsquo;s going well and what&rsquo;s not and why)? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=social-capital>Social Capital</h3><p>Do others want to help you do whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do? In general, work
that matters to the people in your reporting chain is work that builds social
capital. Spend your accumulated social capital wisely. With a high enough star,
you can often get away with chartering an initiative that others don&rsquo;t really
believe in, just on the strength of their faith in you. Managing up includes
understanding your boss&rsquo;s priorities, giving them information they need, and
solving problems that are in their way. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=skills>Skills</h3><p>Any technical skill set slowly becomes less relevant. Increasing skills in your
career comes from three main ways:</p><ul><li>Deliberately setting out to learn something, e.g., hacking on a toy project.</li><li>Working closely with someone who is really skilled.</li><li>Learning by doing; taking on projects that need that skill.</li></ul><p>What stories do you want to be able to tell on your future resume (e.g.,
debugging something difficult; driving a major culture change; turning junior
engineers into senior engineers)? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h2 id=what-if-its-the-wrong-project>What If It&rsquo;s the Wrong Project?</h2><h3 id=do-it-anyway>Do It Anyway?</h3><p>What are the exit criteria and when do you expect to get there? If there&rsquo;s no
end in sight, talk with your manager; hiring staff engineers is difficult and
expensive and most good managers will help you find something more compatible.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=compensate-for-the-project>Compensate for the Project</h3><p>Can you add a side project that gives you the enjoyment, skills growth, or
credibility that you&rsquo;re not getting from your main project? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This suggestion seems prone to over-extending oneself. Assuming that the project
is a full-time commitment, then a side project on top of it can cause burnout.</p></div></div><h3 id=let-others-lead>Let Others Lead</h3><p>There&rsquo;s guaranteed to be work that shows up on your plate on which you can &ldquo;get
an A&rdquo; every single time, and if you give it to someone else, they&rsquo;re probably
going to be a B. However, a B is a pretty good outcome for their first time
doing it. If you&rsquo;re the most senior engineer, make sure you&rsquo;re not taking all of
the opportunities to be publicly competent. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=resize-the-project>Resize the Project</h3><p>Join for the first month to evaluate the direction for feasibility. Recommend
someone else. Care about it for the duration of a meeting and offer advice on
how you&rsquo;d proceed? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><h3 id=just-dont-do-it>Just Don&rsquo;t Do It</h3><p>Either you&rsquo;ll get to it later, or someone else will, or it will stay broken and
that just gets to be OK. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch4></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Does this imply some seniority to be able to make that call with authority. I&rsquo;d
expect junior devs to incline towards implementing rather than declining. As a
tech lead, do you avail room for this option for junior members?</p></div></div><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Reilly2022Ch4>The Staff Engineer's Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change<i>.</i>
