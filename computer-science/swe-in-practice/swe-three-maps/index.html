Be alert to facts that affect
your projects or organization. Continually sift information out of the noise
around you, e.g., a shift in corporate priorities could mean a platform you&rsquo;d
considered but backburnered has become an amazing investment. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><h2 id=the-locator-map-getting-perspective>The Locator Map: Getting Perspective</h2><p>Time you spend absorbed in any domain increases your depth and understanding,
but it comes with some risks, e.g.</p><ul><li>Easy to magnify the importance of what you&rsquo;re working on.</li><li>Start thinking of other technology areas as trivial compared to your rich,
nuanced domain.</li><li>Stop noticing problems as they come background noise. Do your technical
decisions only make sense to people who have forgotten of the world outside
your team?</li><li>Forget what the work is for, does the goal no longer matter to the company?</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><h3 id=seeing-bigger>Seeing Bigger</h3><p>Extending the amount of the map that you can see helps your recognize if your
group is a lot smaller, and if you&rsquo;re far from where the action is. Without this
perspective, you can&rsquo;t do impactful work. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Escape the echo chamber, e.g., an infrastructure engineer might be shocked by a
product engineer who considers creating delighter feature is at least as
important as those features having rock-solid reliability. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Think of other staff engineers as your team. By being a part of something bigger
than your own team, you&rsquo;ll have a more objective view of what everyone is doing.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Understand what matters right now; the ordering will change over time. If
customers are leaving because of a missing core feature, then it&rsquo;s not the time
to push for a focus on technical debt. Ask for skip-level 1:1s and find face
time with customers or teams that depend on you. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>What do your customers care about? For example, a user does not distinguish
between DNS services, ISP, your CDN, or your endpoint &ndash; at the end of the day,
there are a bunch of websites that work, and a bunch that don&rsquo;t. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Respect what came before. Many problems are not essentially new. Study what
other people have done. Your goal is to solve the problem, not necessarily to
write code to solve it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Use publications in your domain to maintain perspective and spot new ideas that
you can explore when you need them, e.g.,
<a href=https://leaddev.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>LeadDev
<i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden=true></i></a>. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>How do I keep up with what&rsquo;s new within Microsoft?</p></div></div><h2 id=the-topographical-map-navigating-the-terrain>The Topographical Map: Navigating the Terrain</h2><h3 id=rough-terrain>Rough Terrain</h3><p>Without a detailed map of the terrain:</p><ul><li>Your good ideas don&rsquo;t get traction. Being right is half the battle. You need
to convince other people that you&rsquo;re right, and even more difficult, convince
them to care that you&rsquo;re right.</li><li>You don&rsquo;t find about the difficult parts until you get there. Had you known,
you&rsquo;d have taken a different path or solved the hardest part of the problem
first.</li><li>Everything takes longer. There are times of the year when it&rsquo;ll be easier to
make a case for action than others.</li></ul><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><h3 id=understanding-your-organization>Understanding Your Organization</h3><p>How much does everyone know? Is information currency that no one gives away
easily? Are channels invite-only; how would you know what exists? Is everything
open, such that you incur decision fatigue from choosing which information to
consume or which documents are official? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>How much writing and review is involved in decisions? Does the org prefer quick
conversations where a design document longer than a page just doesn&rsquo;t get read?
Will the lack of a design document make you seem sloppy and irresponsible? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Top-down or bottom-up? Do initiatives that need broader support slow down at the
grassroots, or come down from above missing local context? If you have a new
idea, where do you need to take it? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>If the org moves like lightning, you&rsquo;ll want an incremental path that shows
value immediately. In a more deliberate environment, you&rsquo;ll need to show that
you&rsquo;ve thought through the whole plan. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Do people in different groups talk to each other via back channels or front
doors? Maybe you need to chat with a counterpart engineer in another org. Maybe
you need to send your idea up until the first common higher-up. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>If everyone&rsquo;s allocated, then any initiative that frees up time without major
investment will have the most impact. If folks are available, chances are that a
Cambrian explosion of grass-root initiatives are nigh and more impact will come
from choosing helping over a nascent project over the finish line. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Liquid or crystallized? Did the seniors look for promotion, or did they stay
where they were, got a project, got support from the group, and got the
promotion when it was their turn? Do you need to hustle for promotion? Should
you move from group to group to find high-impact work? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>An alternate lens: the Westrum organizational typology model:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pathological</th><th>Bureaucratic</th><th>Generative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Power-oriented</td><td>Rule-oriented</td><td>Performance-oriented</td></tr><tr><td>Low cooperation</td><td>Modest cooperation</td><td>High cooperation</td></tr><tr><td>Messengers shot</td><td>Messengers neglected</td><td>Messengers trained</td></tr><tr><td>Responsibilities shirked</td><td>Narrow responsibilities</td><td>Risks shared</td></tr><tr><td>Bridging discouraged</td><td>Bridging tolerated</td><td>Bridging encouraged</td></tr><tr><td>Failure -> scapegoating</td><td>Failure -> justice</td><td>Failure -> inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>Novelty crushed</td><td>Novelty -> problems</td><td>Novelty implemented</td></tr></tbody></table><p>High-trust cultures that emphasize information flow have better software
delivery performance. More tech companies aim to have a generative culture. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><h3 id=points-of-interest>Points of Interest</h3><p>Fortresses gate-keep because they care about something, e.g., reliability, code
quality, etc.. Know the password to pass through the fortress gates, e.g.,
proving a mitigation of all risks of your proposed change, completed checklists,
replying to many comments with acceptable answers. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Areas of disputed territory (each group says, &ldquo;Yes, as far as I know, but you
should also ask&mldr;") are risky. Some areas are uncrossable deserts (e.g., too
big, politically messy). You should have enough evidence to convince yourself
and others that this time it&rsquo;ll be different. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Efficient processes ensure that the official ways to do something are also the
easiest ways. Sometimes, the official way is the way that everyone learns not to
use, e.g., the one person in IT that responds to DMs, saving waiting time. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Where do decisions happen? Is it in a weekly managers meeting? A Slack channel
with the leadership team? Is there no &ldquo;room&rdquo; at all and decisions are made with
1:1s with the most senior leader? When asking to join the room, show how
including you makes your organization better at achieving its goals. Reduce the
cost of including you: show up prepared, speak concisely, and be a
collaborative, low-friction contributor. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Know the shadow org chart. While Jan is the official technical leader, it might
be that her first move in any decision is to check in with Sam, a team veteran.
If Sam doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea, you&rsquo;ll never get Jan on board. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Proactively build bridges if the terrain is difficult to navigate, e.g., send
the email summary that no one is sending; introduce two people who should have
spoken a month ago; write a document showing how projects connect to each other.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>When you can, define your scope to cross tectonic plates and encompass all of
some system or problem domain. That way, you can catch work that is getting
dropped, mediate conflicts, and help create a single story about what&rsquo;s
happening. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><h3 id=keeping-your-topographical-map-up-to-date>Keeping Your Topographical Map Up to Date</h3><p>On an average day, you might need to know: a team you depend on has a new lead;
project you&rsquo;ve been waiting on isn&rsquo;t happening at all; quarterly planning is
about to start; a useful new platform is launching; your product manager is
about to go on extended leave. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Join channels and email lists dedicated for sharing new design documents,
announcing outages, or linking change-management tickets. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Walk the floor. Pair on occasional changes, managing incidents, or deploying a
system that you want to know more about. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Lurk. Pay attention to information that isn&rsquo;t secret exactly, but isn&rsquo;t
necessarily for you, e.g., reading senior people&rsquo;s calendars, skimming agenda
for meetings you&rsquo;re not in, sorting Slack channels by most recently created. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>If organization has a mature documentation culture, make time for skimming and
deeply reading RFCs, design documents, product briefs, etc. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Check in often with your leadership for behind-the-scenes updates. Ensure that
the way you&rsquo;re thinking is still aligned with the way you&rsquo;re leaders are. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><p>Talk to people outside engineering: product, sales, marketing, legal, etc.
Admins know what&rsquo;s going on, and they tend to be the most fascinating people in
the company. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Reilly2022Ch2></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Reilly2022Ch2>The Staff Engineer's Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change<i>.</i>
