    A collection of snippets related to topics that I'm interested in, with 
    links to the original sources. I add the content incrementally on OneNote 
    as I read about more stuff. Occasionally, I convert the pages to HTML 
    using the <a href="https://www.onenotegem.com/gem-menu-for-mac-onenote.html">
    Gem Menu for OneNote</a> and post them here. Please suggest related content 
    that I should check out!
