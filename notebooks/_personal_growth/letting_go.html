           11/2018 (DHH) You Probably Won't Make it to the Top
          </span>

        <p>
         Fallacy:
         <span>
          If you really set your mind to it, you can do
         it. Get to the very top. Beat out all the others. That&rsquo;s how I did it. I just
         wanted it more, worked hard, and eventually all my dreams came true. I won&rsquo;t
         say it&rsquo;s easy, but it&rsquo;s up to you!
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Odds
         are overwhelmingly that you will not make it to the top. There just isn&rsquo;t
         enough room up there, on the top. Why give simultaneous false hope and a
         false idol to so many when you know that it just isn&rsquo;t going to happen for
         the vast majority?
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         top is full of people who hate what they had to do or who they had to become
         to get there. Even for the people who get there with a clean conscience often
         end up disappointed by how shallow the satisfaction really is.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stop
         playing games where you can&rsquo;t set the rules. Start winning the ones where you
         can. But you do have control over whether you&rsquo;re doing a good job, as
         measured by your personal sense of satisfaction in the work.

           10/2018 (Housel): Humble Exits

         Jack
         Welch declined $110m for a 10th season of Seinfeld because he was done with
         the show. He wanted to end the show on the same kind of peak.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         show was based on recreating real events from his and Larry David's normal
         life. They were running out of material because it had been so long since
         they experienced a normal life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Quitting
         or adjusting paths on top is hard because no one knows where the top is. If
         your success pushes you away from doing things that had been fundamental to
         that success, you're probably at the top!

          Learn when to admit
         failure.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         It's
         important to have a watershed moment, the moment of humbling realization. To
         acknowledge a fundamental problem, not to divide it into palatable bite-size
         mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not
         all mistakes are disguised successes. Don't paint all failures as learning
         experiences.

          LTCM were exploiting market inefficiencies. Other
         people learned of the tricks. LTCM didn't lose hope. They borrowed more and
         more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins.

         It
         takes less courage to visualize an uncomfortable state of affairs as a
         thought experiment than to consider how likely it is to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes,
         people do get over things. Newly minted quadriplegics are not as sad 6 months
         later as they expected to be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Be a
         true coward. Plan out and visualize every step of your retreat before you
         first come to battle.

        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           A belief has long remained
              in your mind.

         </li>
         <li>

           It is surrounded by a cloud
              of known arguments and refutations.

           You have sunk costs in it
              (time, public declarations)
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           The belief has emotional
              consequences.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           The belief has gotten mixed
              up with your personality.
