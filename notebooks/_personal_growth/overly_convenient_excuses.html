          If
         Santa-belief is destroyed by truth, the children will lose their sense of
         wonder and stop behaving nicely. It does not follow that Santa-ism is the
         best of all possible alternatives.
         </span>

        <p>
         People
         justify questionable policy by pointing to a supposed benefit over the null
         action. The search for alternatives can go on forever, so one needs a
         stopping criterion. However, sometimes our conscious motives for the search
         don't square up with our subconscious influences, e.g.
         <span>
          Searching for altruistic alternatives, but settling
         for one that's not extremely altruistic, but has some personal convenience.

          To be
         humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own errors. To
         confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not humble; it is
         boasting of your modesty.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Good
         humility:
         <span>
          Engineer humbly designs fail-safe
         mechanisms into machinery, even though they are damn sure the machinery won't
         fail.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Bad humility:
         </span>
         <span>
          But who can really know whether evolution is correct? It is
         just a theory.
         </span>
         <span>
          Do not refuse to integrate
         massive weights of evidence in favor of an uncomfortable conclusion
         </span>

          The
         lottery is a sink of emotional energy. It encourages people to invest in
         their dreams, their hopes for a better future, into an infinitesimal
         probability.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         People
         can't devalue the emotional force of pleasant anticipation by a factor of
         .0000001 without dropping the line of reasoning entirely. They usually treat
         the calculated utility as one argument to be balanced against their pleasant
         anticipations. Ideally, the calculations should override, not balance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Suggestion:
         Let the lottery pay out every 5 years on average, at a random time. That way,
         you buy in once, and get a few years of epsilon chance of becoming rich!
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           Yes,
              offering people tempting dreams that will not actually happen sure is a
              valuable service. People are willing to pay; it must be valuable. The
              alternative is that consumers are making mistakes, and we all know that
              can't happen.
          </span>
         </li>
        </ul>

          The Odds Scale
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         O = P / (1 - P) and
         P = O / (1 + O)
        </p>
        <p>
         When you transform
         probabilities to odds, 0 goes to 0, but 1 goes to infinity. Now the absolute
         truth doesn't look like it should be easy to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you transform
         probabilities to odds, 0.502 and 0.503 goes to 1.008 and 1.012, and 0.9999
         and 0.99999 go to 9,999 and 99,999. When working in log odds, the distance
         between any two degrees of uncertainty equals the amount of evidence you'd
         need to go from one to the other.
        </p>
        <p>

          (Humans
         and chimps have 98% shared DNA.) Maybe the DNA is just similar by
         coincidence. You say the odds are tiny, but there's still a chance, right?
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         problem is that probability theory sometimes lets us calculate a chance which
         is, indeed, too tiny to be worth the mental space to keep track of it - but
         by that time, you've already calculated it. Why should you give up a belief
         if its likelihood is zero, but keep it if its likelihood is 1/googol?
        </p>
        <p>
         Science
         admits to uncertainty. But in religion, where the scriptures are allegedly
         from God, confessing any flaw in them is an attack on their authority.
         Claiming certainty is thus mandatory whether you're certain or not.

           01/2019 (Less Wrong): I Want It My Way!
          </span>

        </p>
        <p>
         Letting go of how
         you think things should be lets you see how things are. Consequently, you'll
         be able to get better results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Wanting it my way:
         <span>
          I believe that failure is bad, and that if I fail,
         then I personally am I failure. So I have those two things conflated. Then
         anything I do risks failing, especially new things, so I'd better not do the
         new things, then.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Remedies:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           Keep doing
              small things at the boundaries, to see my own edges and expand myself.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Embrace
              the principles of MVP. Only then will I truly learn and grow.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Compassionately
              spend time in the not-knowing, when working in new domains. In the end I
              have to let go of something, in order to have something new.
          </span>
