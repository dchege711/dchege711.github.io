          Once you tell a lie, the truth is your enemy; and
         every truth is connected to that truth, and every ally of the truth in
         general; all of those you must oppose, to protect the lie.

          And because it's true, it is what is there to be
         interacted with.

         Modern
         Orthodox Judaism has a tradition of inquiry. But you only attack targets for
         the purpose of defending them. You're allowed to doubt, but not to
         successfully doubt.

         only

         for miscarriages and
         still births and crib deaths, you can build up quite a lopsided picture of
         God's benevolent personality. You don't even get to blurt
         <span>
          "God works in mysterious ways!"

         may generate some nice warm and

         By
         rehearsing arguments that one already knew, one will erroneously double count
         your evidence such that it defeats an army of counter-evidence. Instead, rile
         up both sides and pit them in a fair fight.

         Rationality
         seeks more accuracy for our beliefs by changing them. Rationalization
         operates to fix beliefs already in place.

       </div>
       <div>
        <p>
         For
         every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of
         counter-evidence. You may find your belief drifting downward and further
         downward. Finally, there is no point in constructing excuses. You have
         already relinquished your cherished belief.

         Most court
         processes work on the theory that every case has exactly two opposed sides
         and that it is easier to find two biased humans than one unbiased one.
         Between the prosecution and the defense,
         <span>
          someone
         </span>
         has a motive to present any given piece of evidence, so the court will see
         all the evidence.

         The
         problem with using binary qualitative reasoning is that any single
         observation either destroys the theory or it does not. When not even a single
         contrary observation is allowed, it creates a cognitive dissonance and has to
         be argued away.

         A
         probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as the
         hits don't keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in public
         opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a false theory no
         successes.

         In
         real life, you have to gather evidence, which may be costly. At some point
         you have to decide that you have enough evidence to stop and choose. A
         motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion;
         a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the
         conclusion.

        <p>
         Suspect
         motivated stopping when you close off the search, after coming to a
         comfortable conclusion, and yet there is a lot of fast cheap evidence you
         haven't gathered yet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Suspect
         motivated continuation when some evidence is leaning in a way that you don't
         like, but you decide that more (expensive) evidence is needed before you'll
         have to do anything uncomfortable.
