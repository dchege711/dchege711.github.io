        <ol>
         <li>
          <span>
           Scan resources
              and pick the ones that seem most useful (5 hours)
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Set up the environment and
              define structured goals (3 hours)
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Work towards increasingly
              difficult goals set in step 2 (22 hours)
          </span>
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Each session should
         be about 4 hours. It takes about 20min to get into the flow.

         Avoid shallow work:
         <span>
          non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style
         tasks that tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to
         replicate.

         (Paul Graham) The Age of the Essay
          </span>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         An
         essay is something that you write to try and figure out something. By
         definition, you can't begin with a statement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expressing
         ideas helps you form them. Writing something that others might read forces
         you to think well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Think
         of the essay as an idea graph. At each node, contrary to Geoffrey's Principle
         of Least Astonishment for UIs, branch out to the most interesting related
         idea.

         Tips
         on generating these surprises:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           Write about things that
              you've thought of a lot.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Observe a lot. The more
              anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice new ones
          </span>
         </li>
        </ul>
       </div>
