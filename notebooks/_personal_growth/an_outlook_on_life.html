         Filtering
         out information is an art, not a science, necessitated by the information
         overload that we live in.

           Watch out for the tendency
              to only preserve information that meshes with how we think the world
              should be.

           If you think the world is
              all art, you miss how much stuff is too complicated to think about
              intuitively.

           If you think the world is
              all data, you'll miss how much is too complicated to summarize in a
              statistic.

         Some
         of it is our own fault (e.g. arguing online). Some of it is forced by
         circumstances that we choose to endure (e.g. unnecessary meetings at work)
        </p>
        <p>
         Choosing
         a bullshit minimizing path is error-prone. Your priorities change over time.
         Periodically evaluate where you are. It helps to have measurable aspects of
         your life.

          Luck and risk are different sides of the same coin.
         </span>
         People
         underestimate the role of luck and risk. There are a billion investors. By
         sheer chance, we expect a couple of them to be billionaires predominantly off
         luck. But it's hard to point fingers after the fact.

          "Some people are born into families that
         encourage education; others are against it. Some are born into flourishing
         economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and
         destitution. Dear Son, I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn
         it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty
         is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including
         yourself."

         If you want
         success, figure out the price and then pay it. Figuring out this price is
         hard.
