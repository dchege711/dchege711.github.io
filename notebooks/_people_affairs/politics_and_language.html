     Fiat
     news:
     <span>
      news which broadly cheapens the
     credibility of media by presenting opinion as fact.

       It seeks to present
          subjective judgments and opinions as fact.

      <span>
       It elects itself as arbiter,

       In the hands of actors who
          wish to tell you how to think about a topic and not just inform you, it
          can do more to debase confidence in information and news than any other
          kind of media activity.

     The
     political center does not hold. For any centrist candidate, there exists a
     winning majority of voters on both the left AND the right who will favor a
     competing candidate on both the left AND the right.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     centrist commercial identity doesn't hold. No appreciable difference between
     Nike and Adidas shoes. But Nike wants to sell you on what it tells the world
     about you to wear a Nike shoe.
    </p>

     Trump
     embraced and actively created his obvious cartoonish-ness. Hillary had her
     cartoon imposed on her unwillingly, to disastrous result.

     Nobody
     knows what the future holds, even with immediate predictions, e.g.
     <span>
      if minimum wage gets raised&hellip;

     On
     the long haul, pundits do no better than chance. Previously, pundits provided
     context about what had already happened, a legitimate function of expertise.
     Nowadays, they discuss what may happen yet they have no benefit of expertise.
     Read futurists' magazines from a couple of years ago and realize they don't
     know more about the future than you or

     Unwarranted
     credibility: simply appearing in the media provides credibility. Murray
     Gell-Mann Effect:
     <span>
      Open the newspaper to an
     article on some subject that you know well. Often, the article is so wrong it
     actually reverses cause and effect. In any case, you read with
     exasperation/amusement. You then turn the page to international affairs and
     read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about
     Palestine than the baloney you just read.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Speculation
     is cheap, and most importantly, you cannot lose. You're wrong at least 50% of
     the time, but nobody remembers and therefore nobody cares. Beware of the
     unknowable/hard questions since speculation can't be disproven,
     <span>
      e.g. origin of life on earth, SETI, string theory
     </span>
     .

    <p>
     What's
     wrong with media's speculation craze?
     <span>
      Tendency
     to be excessive in order to make drama. Events aren't compelling, but they
     need to be made into a crisis. People might think that conflicts IRL also
     need to be polarized. Hysteria (Y2K) and hasty litigation (breast implants).

     Border
     fences and walls are not uncommon. They're not inherently hateful. They're
     also not particularly effective.
    </p>
    <p>
     Except
     it isn't the wall. It's a meme of
     <span>
      The Wall!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     For
     Trump supporters,
     <span>
      The Wall
     </span>
     is a
     mirroring engagement. It stands for willingness to defend the borders and
     integrity of the nation, for putting interests of taxpayers first, for
     standing by Trump.
    </p>
    <p>
     For
     Trump opponents,
     <span>
      The Wall
     </span>
     is a rage
     engagement. It stands for hatred and mistrust of foreigners, for unjust
     anti-immigrant sentiment, for Trump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realize
     that the debate is not about the thing but the abstraction, about all the
     things that each policy supposedly stand for.

     Perhaps,
     <span>
      given that
     </span>
     a thing is 'human', then the probabilities of it
     speaking, wearing clothes, and having the standard number of fingers, are all
     independent.
     <span>
      Although this reasoning usually
     isn't quite true, pretending it's true can simplify the living daylights out
     of your calculations without you being way off.

     It's illegal to refuse
     to condition prior beliefs on new evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Choose
     your definitions wisely. The mere act of creating a word can cause your mind
     to allocate a category, and thereby trigger unconscious inferences of
     similarity. To categorize is to lose some information. Things given the same
     name end up dumped in the same mental bucket, blurring them together into the
     same point on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     strongest definitions use a crossfire of intensional (using other words) and
     extensional (pointing to examples) communication to nail down a concept. Even
     so, you can only communicate maps to concepts, or instructions for building
     concepts - you don't communicate the actual categories as they exist in your
     mind or in the world.

      The Parable of Hemlock.
     </span>
     <span>
      "
     </span>
     <span>
      All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore
     Socrates is mortal. It is not merely a guess, but a logical certainty."
     </span>
     And they waited, and they waited, and they waited&hellip;
     <span>
      "Socrates appears not to be mortal. Then Socrates must not be a
     man. And that is not merely a guess, but a logical certainty.
     </span>
     But by
     their definition, we cannot call Socrates a man until after we observe his to
     be mortal.

      The Parable of the Dagger.
     </span>
     The first box was
     inscribed:
     <span>
      Either both inscriptions are true,
     or both transcriptions are false.
     </span>
     And the second box was inscribed:
     <span>
      This box contains the key.
     </span>
     The jester opened
     the second box and found a dagger.
     <span>
      "It's
     logically impossible!" "It's entirely possible. I merely wrote
     those inscriptions on two boxes, and then I put the dagger in the second one.

      "If a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it, does it
     make a sound?"
     </span>
     If you ask,
     <span>
      "Are
     there acoustic vibrations?"
     </span>
     or
     <span>
      "Are
     there auditory experiences"
     </span>
     , you discover that the argument is
     really about the definition of the word 'sound'

     Is
     the number 29,384,209 prime? By virtue of how I define my decimal system and
     my axioms of arithmetic, I have already determined my answer to the question
     - but I do not know what the answer is yet, and I must do some logic to find
     out.

     But
     an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing
     the same effect in intensified form. The language becomes ugly and inaccurate
     because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes
     it easy for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is
     reversible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standard
     phrases already have rhythm. They are a convenient shortcut for lazy
     communicators.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pretentious
     diction to make the banal appear profound, the biased seem scientifically
     impartial and sordid events masquerade as dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some
     words are not meant to point to any discoverable object, e.g.
     <span>
      praising a country as democratic
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     We
     need to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way round. The
     first line of defense is not to define your problematic terms, but to see
     whether you can think without using those terms at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     If
     you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy.
     You can't speak of any dialects, and when you make a stupid remark, its
     stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Passive
     voice obscures reality.
     <span>
      "The subjects
     were administered Progenitorivox".
     </span>
     In reality, the scientist is
     there, and the subjects are students and the Progenitorivox was handed over
     with instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
     If a
     metaphor doesn't evoke an image, don't use it. Tired/Dying metapahors are a
     lazy man's game. A word itself can have the destructive force of clich&eacute;; a
     word itself can carry the poison of a cached thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meaning
     does not excuse impact. Be consciously aware of the experiences that words
     create.
     <span>
      "AI should be developed through
     democratic processes"
     </span>
     can't be excused from signaling the
     audience to applaud. Furthermore, it's as vague as they come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Political
     language has come to consist mainly of euphemism, question-begging and sheer
     cloudy vagueness.

      Defenseless villages are
