         People
         can be misinformed, have incomplete information, be bad at math, be persuaded
         by rotten marketing, misjudge the consequences of their actions but their
         decisions make sense to them in that moment and check all the boxes they need
         to check.

         The
         cornerstone of behavioral finance is that most people assume it's a field
         whose documented flaws apply to other people,
         <span>
          but
         not themselves.

         or have a good chance of getting, we don't. Buying a lottery ticket is the
         only time in our lives we can hold a tangible dream of getting the good stuff
         that you already have and take for granted. We are paying for a dream, and
         you may not understand because you are already living in a dream."

         Few
         1999 investors were greedy. Most didn't actually think the discounted future
         cash flows of Cisco Systems were worth $600b. They thought Cisco stock would
         go up next week.

         Accepting
         that your field is no more important or influential to other people&rsquo;s
         decisions than dozens of other fields.

         A
         barbell personality with confidence on one side and paranoia on the other;
         willing to make bold moves but always within the context of making survival
         the top priority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Understanding
         that facts don&rsquo;t have any meaning unless people pay attention to them, and
         people pay attention to, and remember, good stories.

        <p>
         Humility
         not in the idea that you could be wrong, but given how little of the world
         you&rsquo;ve experienced you are likely wrong, especially in knowing how other
         people think and make decisions.

          <span>
           10/2018: (Steve Lagerfeld) In with the Out Crowd:
         Contrarians, Alone and Together
          </span>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether you&rsquo;re a
         Satanist or an alt-right activist, you sign up for a total lifestyle package
         that includes a limited menu of approved ideas, clothing styles, and other
         badges you can choose from to express your individuality. What you get in
         return is an intense sense of belonging and identity&mdash;we&rsquo;re all pariahs here!
        </p>
        <p>
         A contrarian is by
         definition someone with a singular idea who stands against the crowd. He or
         she takes a risk. August Landmesser risked everything. (He escaped punishment
         for his act of defiance but later served time in a concentration camp and was
         killed in action in 1944 while serving in a penal battalion.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Today's risk is
         social: They risk the disapproval of the crowd - of their friends, family,
         colleagues, community, and society. They might simply face unspoken
         disapproval, or they might be shunned and ostracized or burned at the stake
         of Twitter. Some face criticism and censure or social or professional
         excommunication. They risk their status and prestige. Some risk losing their
         jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the years,
         I&rsquo;ve gone from thinking of my instinctive desire to be a minority of one as a
         distinguishing trait to thinking of it as something more like Asperger&rsquo;s
         syndrome&mdash;a disability that can in rare circumstances be an advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the whole point
         of belonging to the crowd is to demonstrate one&rsquo;s superior moral position, an
         insider&rsquo;s dissent is an intolerable violation and contradiction:

           Ellen Pao,
              who upended the heroically contrarian self-image of Silicon Valley by
              suing her locally fabled employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers,
              for the all-too-mainstream practice of sex discrimination

         In order to move
         ahead, he needed to prove that
         <span>
          H. pylori
         </span>
         is a pathogen, and he saw only one way to do it. So one morning in 1984 he
         drank a brew containing the bacteria. Within days, he was nauseated and
         vomiting; a test showed that his guts were crawling with the bacteria.

          Try to
         determine how much he's overpaying for loss aversion, e.g. medical bills, kid

        <p>
         A
         student knows the rules. A master knows the exceptions. Learn the rules and
         then spend as much time observing how people use and abuse those rules. Read
         outside your field to see how people respond to incentives, think about risk,
         and deal with surprises.
