          Politics is the mind killer

          Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side
         you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all the
         arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing
         your soldiers in the back.

          Reversed stupidity is not
         intelligence.

        <p>
         A
         hundred inventors failing to build flying machines using metal, wood and
         canvas doesn't imply that what you really need is a flying machine made of
         bones and flesh. A fool can't be wrong 99.9% of the time, unless they
         intelligent enough to always pick the wrong answer.

          Correspondence Bias
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Tendency
         to draw inferences on a person's dispositions from behaviors that can be
         entirely explained by the situations in which they occur, e.g.
         <span>
          He's kicking the vending machine - he must be an
         'angry person'. Oh, I'm kicking the fucking vending machine because the bus
         was late and the train was early &amp; the stupid machine has eaten my lunch
         money for the 2nd time in a row.

          Fundamental Attribution
         Error
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Tendency
         to over-attribute others' behavior to their dispositions, while reversing
         this tendency for ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Are your enemies innately
         evil?

        </p>
        <p>
         Everyone
         is the hero of their own story. It's a more inspiring battle cry to scream
         <span>
          'Die, vicious scum!'
         </span>
         instead of
         <span>
          'Die, people who could have been just like me but
         grew up in a different environment.

          How people deal with
         cognitive bias
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Change
         one's view of the facts,
         <span>
          e.g. deny that
         unfair events took place, or edit history to make it appear fair.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Change one's mentality - deny that the events are
         unfair.

        <p>
         <span>
          Affect Heuristic
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         When
         subjective impressions of goodness/badness act as a heuristic, e.g.
         <span>
          "a reactor design produces less waste,
         therefore its probability of meltdown is lower", or "Stalin also
         says X. You wouldn't want to agree with Stalin, would you?

         <span>
          Just World Fallacy
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Tendency
         to attribute consequences to a universal force that restores moral balance.

          Hug the Query
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Learning
         about biases may make one forget to examine direct arguments. When its
         impossible to hug all the queries, at least be aware that you're clinging
         onto an approximation.

          Argument screens off
         authority
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Given
         only claims of a flying machine, I'd trust Lord Kelvin (he might know of
         counterevidence) over Wright Brothers' words.
        </p>
        <p>
         If I
         see the Wrights' calculations, Lord Kelvin's authority becomes less relevant.
         If I watch the plane fly, who cares what Lord Kelvin is?

         In
         truth, no one cares about Confederate war memorials. There's no 'Southern
         Identity' associated with Robert E. Lee statues. It's not like you're
         canceling an SEC football game.
        </p>
        <p>
         But
         tell Southerners that
         <span>
          "THEY are coming
         to take your statues away from you".
         </span>
         Elected Republicans must
         come out in favor of the statues. Elected Democrats must take action to
         dismantle statues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trump's
         tweets and associated narrative construction are a dog whistle for Democrats
         and an obedience collar for the Republicans.
