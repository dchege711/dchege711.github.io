        <p>
         Environmental,
         Social and Governance Investing. So general as to be meaningless: marketing
         BS
         <span>
          (thinking 'holistically' about ESG risk
         factors as part of the investment process)
         </span>
         to impact investing
         <span>
          (providing wholesale financing for community
         lending initiatives).
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         ESG!
         The meme is about selling portfolios as virtue signaling devices. It moves
         the conversation away from fees and performance to
         <span>
          values.

           IBM acquired Phytel,
              Explorys and Truven for their troves of healthcare data and proprietary
              analytics.

           From 2010 to 2015, IBM has
              spent +$15bn and Watson is still not profitable.

            MD Anderson spent $60m on a

           Watson is an amazing
              information retrieval system, but marketing insists on overselling it as
              AI
          </span>

         <li>
          <span>
           IBM's product department
              pivots too much and has non-technical leadership. Watson isn't even in
              the product dept's planned services.

         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           IBM is losing talent. It
              won't win AI. But the CEO still talks of Watson's Law and exponential
              benefits.

           Getting data isn't hard, but
              most of it is in prose form. Good luck cleaning and structuring it. It's
              hard to find domain experts who also know NLP to guide the process.

         People

         Many
         people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
        </p>
        <p>
         PR
         firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But
         PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see
         similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come.
        </p>
        <p>
         With
         trend stories, PR firms line up some experts to talk about the industry
         generally. At the end of the experts, lies the client pulling the strings.
