          Sears. Blockbuster. Nokia. AOL.
         </span>
         You had a
         great idea. You discovered a beautiful beach to lay on, but other people
         didn't just follow you and lay down themselves; they built condos and
         restaurants while you were watching the sunset. Soon your great idea loses
         its appeal. But you put so much work into the great idea that it's become an
         inseparable part of your identity. Then the world changed - as it always does
         - but you kept that mentality of conviction and defense. Patience has turned
         to stubbornness. And now you're the proud owner of a bad idea.

         Being right is the enemy
         of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.
         Knowing you have a competitive advantage reduces the incentive to explore
         other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your chosen strategy.

         Nothing to
         lose is a wonderful thing to have. Having a quarterly dividend to maintain is
         what happens after you build something great. But it can come at the expense
         of what made you successful in the first place.

           2018/09: (Steve Blank) Is the Lean Startup Dead?
          </span>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         Katzenberg
         (Paramount, Disney Studios &amp; DreamWorks) has raised $1.75b for NewTV, a
         startup banking on consumers wanting a subscription for 10-minute programs on
         mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
         After
         the rubble of the dotcom crash, startups and investors needed a lean approach
         to survive long enough to generate revenue and profits.
         <span>
          "Build it and they'll come
         </span>
         "
         wouldn't cut it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Investors
         are now looking for the next Ubers and Airbnbs. The valuations are well
         passed the peak of the 2000 internet bubble. VCs don't have to wait till IPO
         - they can sell part of their investment when they raise the next round.
        </p>
        <p>
         When
         capital for startups is readily available at scale, it makes more sense to go
         big, fast and make mistakes than it does to search for product/market fit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Still,
         unless your startup has access to large pools of capital or have a brand name
         like Katzenberg, Lean still makes sense. Lean is now essential for companies
         and government agencies to&nbsp;deliver innovation at speed.

         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         Institutions
         will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution, e.g.
         <span>
          Turbotax &amp; complex tax system, Taxis vs Ride
         Sharing, Defense Contractors and never-ending wars, Correction officers vs
         pot legalization.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         It's
         easier for incumbents to prolong the problem than to pivot entirely.

           Err on the side of having
              competitors, but make sure that you have a thesis that everyone else is
              overlooking, e.g.
          </span>
          <span>
           Google wasn't averse to users leaving

           In college, take classes in
              different areas in lieu of taking entrepreneurship classes. Chances are
              that there are problems ripe for a software approach.

           Don't try to think of
              startup ideas. Instead, notice problems that you're facing yourself. Be
              an expert in that market.

           PG in the 90s noticed that
              hand-built online stores of custom HTML pages would have to be generated
              by software soon.

           Work on projects that seem
              like they'd be cool. Things that already exist won't seem as interesting
              to build.

           VCs may not be looking for
              growth potential. Younger cash-strapped founders are more likely to cede

         B2C
           is a gamble that requires riding a wave, e.g.

          Google
           rode the early internet adoption wave that created a ballooning amount of
           information.
