         Serendipity often
         masquerades as a skill. Take monetary policy. The top three investing
         policies are patience, temperament and having your career coincide with a
         30-year uninterrupted decline in interest rates.

         Pinning
         down the cause of a successful startup is hard. Hardworking founders, great
         culture&hellip; what about all the other startups that did all those same things and
         failed?

         Isaac
         Newton made 3 bets: physics, alchemy and theology. In hindsight, the last 2
         were a waste of time. But in his time, all 3 fields were equally promising.

         The Facebooks of
         the world are few and far between. Unicorns make for good press. Without a
         desire for fame, an entrepreneur can bootstrap to 2x. 10x is not the only
         definition of success.

         Pre-revenue models
         and exit strategies are not healthy. Essentially passing horseshit to the
         fool in the market.

         When
         we start with a strong prior and encounter strong evidence, usually a long
         series of seemingly predictive data, we stop asking more questions.

          Long term equity returns are always positive.
         Stocks and bonds are negatively correlated. US residential real estate prices
         can't fall.

         We
         miss that our starting inferences assume other inferences as given.

          Wars don't happen any more. Globalism and free
         trade is here to stay. Central Banks have figured out govt indebtedness
         problems. Markets are mature and liquid.

         Investors
         that started their careers in '87, '00 and '08 look at the same data as the
         rest of us, but their updated priors are stuck in time.

         When
         we encounter information that is so afield from any of our priors, we don't
         know how to incorporate it. What if China really does float the Yuan? Could
         our internal political divides really manifest in war?

          Silicon Valley is a system for running
         experiments. It's the nature of these experiments that some fail - the key is
         for the ones that work to really, really work.
