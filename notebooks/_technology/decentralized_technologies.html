         (Appen Warr) XML, Blockchains and the Strange Shapes of Progress
          </span>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         Given
         how hard it is to parse HTML, some brave souls set out to solve the problem
         Once and For All. That was XML.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite
         failing at its primary goal - a less hacky basis for HTML - it was massively
         successful at the related job of encoding other structured data. XML's
         standards compliant validator tools would tell you whether your data was
         valid. If you adopted XML, you never needed to write another parser or
         another output generator.
        </p>
        <p>
         XML
         didn't live up to expectations, but spending a lot of money on
         interoperability sort of did.
         Supply
         chains are a lot more integrated than they used to be.
         Financial systems actually do send
         financial data back and forth. RPCs really do get Remotely Called. All
        </p>
        <p>
         that
         stuff got built during the XML craze.
        </p>
        <p>
         Blockchains
         [purport to] solve centralization, which will turn out not to be the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           We can do consensus in many
              (much cheaper) ways.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Most people don't want their
              transactions or legal agreements published to the world.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Consumers actually like
              transactions to be reversible, within reason; markets work better that
              way.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Companies even like to be
              able to safely unwind legal agreements sometimes when it turns out those
              contracts weren't the best idea.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Companies rarely want the
              public to know about their contracts, let alone their inventory details.
          </span>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         But
         they give us an excuse to forget everything we thought we knew about
         contracts and interoperability and payment clearing. Blockchain math for the
         (digitally signed) "chain of blocks," is awesome. Exhibit A: Git

           12/2000: (Clay Shirky) The Case Against
         Micropayments
          </span>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         A
         transaction can't be worth so much as to require a decision but worth so
         little that that decision is automatic. The anxiety of buying is a permanent
         feature of micropayments since economic decisions are made on the margin.
         Beneath a certain price, goods/services become harder to value.
        </p>
        <p>
         Users
         want predictable and simple pricing. Micropayments waste the user's mental
         effort in order to conserve cheap resources. Microtransactions assume
         content, cycles and disk are precious commodities and assume that the user's
         time is free.
        </p>
        <p>
         PayPal
         doesn't lower mental transactions nor do they make it easier for users to
         value a penny's worth of anything. They simply make it possible for users to
         spend their money once they've decided to.
        </p>

         solutions for simple pricing vs cheap-but-not-free are:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           Aggregation.
          </span>
          <span>
           The
              'Disneyland' pricing model. Bundles several purchase decisions hence
              lowering mental transaction costs,
          </span>
          <span>
           e.g. newspapers.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Subscription.
          </span>
          <span>
           Producers value
              predictability:
          </span>
          <span>
           trade lower subscription prices in return for lump sum
              payments and more predictable revenue streams.
          </span>
          <span>
           Also motivates each party to
              live up to their part of the bargain.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Subsidy.
          </span>
          <span>
           Get someone else to pay.
              Advertisers subsidize revenue. The weblog movement, the biggest source
              of subsidy on the net overall, is user subsidized.

          Micropayment proponents have long suggested that
         micropayments will work because it would be great if they did. But users want
         a system that is simple, predictable and easily valued.

           Advertisers, the ones with

              suppliers. Users, the ones with the eyeballs, hate ads so much that

           For more than 20 years,
              people have unsuccessfully chased the Holy Grail of micro-payments.
              Bitcoin can't even handle payments. The Lightning Network doesn't work
              and isn't decentralized.

           ICOs make customers pre-pay
              for services they hope to eventually obtain from the startup. This is
              almost the inverse of sustainable.

         Permissionless
         anonymity is the primary use case of decentralized systems. Can you trust the
         likes of Facebook and Google? History says absolutely not, but also says that
         most people don't care. Two things could make them care:

           A complete deterioration of

           06/2018: (DSHR) The 4 Most Expensive Words: This
         Time It Will Be Different
          </span>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         The edge of the
         internet isn't dominated by desktop computers, continuously connected and
         powered up, with low latency, no bandwidth charges and mostly empty hard
         disks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mechanisms needed
         to prevent cheating among peers are hard to implement in practice or tend to
         require centralization.
        </p>
        <p>
         Peers would still
         need to contribute more space than they could receive in return. The
         replication factor would need to be higher than in a centralized storage
         network.
        </p>
        <p>
         Storage is a lot
         less free, thus less of an incentive. Users hate micropayments because they
         don't take user preferences into account..
        </p>
        <p>
         P2 will be slower
         than S3, require encryption because of lack of access controls, be less
         reliable, have volatile pricing, and have a more complex user interface and
         API because of bidding. P2 can't charge more than S3. And S3 already has
         notoriously low margins. S3's price has been dropping, so the speculations on
         P2's price aren't good for providers. And if P2 manages through S3, what
         prevents Amazon from running P2-on-S3 and capturing the bulk of the market?
        </p>
        <p>
         Economies of scale
         in P2P networks tend to make the network centralized. Income is linear, but
         costs are sublinear due to economies of scale. The network will be dominated
         by a few participants.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like almost all
         crypto, Filecoin is a way to transfer wealth from later to earlier
         participants. The VCs paid about $0.80. The earliest buyer paid $1.30.
         Filecoin is trading at $7.26, down from a peak of $29.59.
