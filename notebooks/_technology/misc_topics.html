           (09/2018: NY Times Op-Ed) The Dangers of DNA Testing

        <p>
         108
         crime labs given same DNA mixture and asked to compare it with DNA from 3
         suspects (one innocent) from a mock bank robbery.
        </p>
        <p>
         74
         labs wrongly said that the sample included DNA evidence from the 3rd suspect.
        </p>
        <p>
         If
         the labs found a match, they were required to report a match statistic that
         indicates the odds that the match is coincidental or innocent. Among the 108
         labs, the match statistics varied over 100-trillion fold.
        </p>
        <p>
         There
         are methods (e.g. TrueAllele by Cybergenetics) to reanalyze old DNA mixture
         data using software that can help analysts correct errors without any new lab
         testing.

          Investigators upload sample from
         30-year old rape kit to GEDmatch. Site provides great-great-great
         grandparents. Investigators then piece out family trees, rough age and
         location of the suspect. Neither he or any of his immediate relatives had
         made their DNA public.

         OCR tends to miss
         (sometimes) really important context.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make use of derived
         data, e.g.
         <span>
          age at marriage, gender
         differences, mortality rates, mapping migrations, last names

         Try a sequence of
         things, not one big idea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Don't expect
         existing tools to do the whole job. All the while, building new tools is not
         as straightforward.

         IBM
         is at 50 qubits. Google has 72 qubits in design. Shor's algorithm for
         factoring big primes requires more than 10k error corrected qubits. Current
         error correcting codes need 49 qubits per qubit.
