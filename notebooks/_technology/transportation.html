          Uber

         Furthermore, the increased congestion, emissions and demand for road space
         are not compensated for in Uber's predatory pricing.

          their predicament.
         </span>
         Successful
         transit is mass transit, and by definition, won't serve the elites.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tech
         marketing is all about appealing to elite personal tastes on the assumption
         that whatever we sell to the wealthy today can be sold to the masses
         tomorrow. But cars in dense cities stop working when everybody buys them.

          Traffic congestion would improve due to increased
         passenger areal density by eliminating the center aisle and putting seats
         where there are currently entryways, and matching acceleration and braking to
         other vehicles, thus avoiding the inertial impedance to smooth traffic flow
         of traditional heavy buses
         </span>
         .

         This
         increases Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT). Increasing VMT means your taking
         more space to move the same number of Engineering can solve increased
         emissions and road carnage, but not the geometry problem.

          The Ridership vs Coverage Problem
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Low-ridership
         and high-coverage systems make little business sense, but may be necessary
         because some feel entitled to service (e.g. paying taxes) or badly needs the
         service (e.g. We'll be trapped otherwise)

         <span>
          Designing a Ridership Maximizing Transit System
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         elapsed time between consecutive buses matter. High frequency reduces wait
         time, makes connections easy, and is a backstop for problems of reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
         As
         transit ridership goes up, responsiveness to each individual's desires and
         needs goes down. The big-city subway doesn't take care of your personal
         needs, but that's inseparable from why it's massively liberating to so many
         people.

         Suppose
         we fix frequency and speed of travel constant. How far do we have to go to be
         available to a given number of people? We'll consider:

        <ul>
         <li>
          <span>
           The number of people, jobs
              and activities near each stop (denser areas win)
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           Is it possible to walk
              between the stop and activities around it (grid-like areas win)
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <span>
           How direct does the trip
              feel? (like how you feel bored stopping at Lakeside instead of directly
              at the Wa)
