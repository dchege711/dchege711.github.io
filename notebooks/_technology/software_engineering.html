         Express
         POOL includes extra wait time between requesting and matching with a car and
         a short walk to their pick-up location; these changes create straighter, more
         efficient routes, in turn leading to a more affordable trip.
        </p>
        <p>
         Riders
         were cancelling their trips in the time between request and matching - a
         period that included the extra wait time - at a high rate relative to other
         products.
        </p>
        <p>
         We
         dove into the behavioral science literature to gather insights about people&rsquo;s
         perceptions of time and waiting. We identified three concepts:

         We
         recommended explaining each granular step going on behind the scenes, like
         identifying other riders traveling the same way and finding a car for the
         trip. Additional information&mdash;for example, explaining the arrival time
         estimate calculation&mdash;could be provided by clicking an info icon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         Express POOL team tested these ideas in an A/B experiment and observed an 11
         percent reduction in the post-request cancellation rate.

           (10/2018: Ask HN) What is your best advice for a junior software

         If
         you successfully adopt the mindset of
         <span>
          "whatever
         the computer is telling is true from the computer point of view, so I'd
         better make sure I've read it"
         </span>
         instead of
         <span>
          "anyway, I'll try something else and run again"
         </span>
         ,
         you'll debug 10 times faster.

        <p>
         After
         your X allotted time, even if you are still feeling energized, go spend that
         energy jogging or something! Work a craft, learn to play an instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
         A
         really good question to ask for a task is "How do you know you are
         done?"
        </p>
        <p>
         Don't
         follow your passion. Passion will come if your work is meaningful, you are
         competent and respected for it. So instead work on your competency in
         whatever field. Leave if the environment will never respect you anyways.
        </p>
        <p>
         When
         you have a conversation with anyone where you think a plan was verbally
         agreed on, write it in an email, send it to them as confirmation and find at
         least 1 other person, ideally in your reporting line, which you can cc it
         too.
        </p>
        <p>
         Don't
         stress about not being good enough when you see other people's work. People
         show off their end result and not the hundreds of broken iterations it took
         to get there.
        </p>
        <p>
         Learn
         to code fearlessly: Are you being asked to run queries on a production box?
         <span>
          Ask if you can get a user with read-only
         permissions
         </span>
         . Change crusty old code?
         <span>
          Maybe
         put a quick test harness around it.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Understand
         that code is often ugly and weird for a reason other than incompetence. Code
         quality tends to be a function of time, requirements, experience, and skill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Learn
         how to present. You're going to have to make a case for your ideas in
         meetings. You'll also have to defend your actions sometimes, particularly
         with respect to operations and support.
        </p>
        <p>
         A
         senior developer (or any productive person) is good at saying no. People will
         ask for more of your time than you can spare. You can gently but firmly say
         no, direct people elsewhere (delegate), or ask people to discuss with your
         manager whether more of your time can be allocated to help them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Languages
         are tools, and you are a craftsman (or woman). In the same vein, a carpenter
         doesn&rsquo;t scoff at using a wide variety of tools and of course has favorites
         but doesn&rsquo;t get caught up in them.

          Find a mentor. I was lucky enough to have a couple more
         experienced developers take me under their wing when I was new. I learned so
         much from them. This idea of mentorship has fallen out of favor, but I now
         understand "there is nothing new under the sun".

          Carnivores eat herbivores; herbivores eat plants.
         Players would embark on quests to kill the carnivores, and the pelts they
         gained from these quests would be worth more than those gained from
         herbivores.

         Reality:
         <span>
          Players ran over the world like a swarm of ants
         that consumed every living thing as fast as it was possible to spawn it. Not
         even spreading players into multiple servers could control the furry creature
         population. The developers gave up trying to balance the ecology and removed
         that code.

         So
         which is better? Well unsurprisingly, neither. You need both viewpoints,

          Of course inverse kinematics is a better way
         to do things. You just tell the arm or leg or whatever where you want it to
         go, and it automatically moves the elbows and knees and such for you. So
         surely that's less work, and therefore better?

         Is
         C++ an insane language where you can do anything, but only at compile time?
         Perhaps Python is a cleaner approach, by pushing all problems to runtime, but
         even they're now starting to realize that maybe type annotations are a useful
         feature.

         Languages
         like JavaScript have just this year invented co-routines and are now treating
         it like the second-coming. But can you imagine trying to write web-apps in C?
         At least JavaScript has a string type.
