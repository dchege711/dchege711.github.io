            2018/04 (NY Mag) An Apology for the Internet - How
          It Went Wrong

             Silicon Valley dream was
                born of the counterculture - a generation of programmers and designers
                embracing new technology as a tool to transform the world for good.

             Can Duruk:
            </span>
            <span>
             You were
                going to Facebook not to work but to make the world more open and
                connected.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            Then mix in capitalism on

            <span>
             To transform the world,
                you first need to take it over. The planetary scale and power turned
                out to be as well suited for making money as they were for saving the
                world.

             Just as FB became the
                first overnight social-media success, the stock market crashed,
                sending money-minded investors westward toward the tech industry.

            <span>
             It
                wasn't just the hippies showing up anymore. There was a lot more of
                the libertarian, screw-the-government ethos, that whole idea of
                move-fast-break-things-and-damn-the-consequences that still flies
                under the marketing shell of 'making the world a better place'
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            And we paid a high price
               for keeping it free.

            <span>
             To avoid charging for the
                internet - while becoming fabulously rich at the same time - SV turned
                to digital ads. But to sell ads that target individual users, you need
                to grow a big audience - and use advancing tech to gather realms of
                personal data that will enable you to reach them more efficiently.

            <span>
             They
                wanted more people on their platforms. They didn't care if the people
                were good. They just wanted more bodies with different IP addresses
                loading up ads.
            </span>

          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            Everything was designed to
               be really, really addictive
           </span>

            <span>
             'Engagement' was the
                euphemism for the metric, but in practice it evolved into an
                unprecedented machine for behavior modification.
            </span>
           </li>
           <li>

             Jaron Lanier:
            </span>
            <span>
             Anger is
                the emotion most effective at driving 'engagement' - which also makes
                it, in a market for attention, the most profitable one.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            At first, it worked -
               almost too well
           </span>
          </li>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <span>
             None of the companies lied
                about how their money was made. But as users became deeply enmeshed in
                the increasingly addictive web of surveillance, the leading digital
                platforms became wildly popular.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            No one from the Valley was
               held accountable
           </span>
          </li>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <span>
             No one seemed interested
                in bringing such a wealthy, dynamic sector to heel.
            </span>
           </li>
           <li>
            <span>
             People don't assign moral
                agency to algorithms.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            Even as social networks
               became dangerous and toxic
           </span>
          </li>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <span>
             User security took a
                backseat to growth and engagement. Resources went to selling ads, not
                protecting users from abuse.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
           <span>
            And even as they invaded
               our privacy
           </span>
          </li>
          <ul>

            <span>
             The more features the
                platforms added, the more data users willingly, if unwittingly,
                released to them.

             There have always been
                outsiders who criticized the tech industry - even if their concerns
                have been drowned by the oohs and aahs of consumers, investors, and
                journalists.

            <span>
             Execs aren't likely to do
                so. But maybe the employees can rise up and make a change.

           </li>
           <li>
            <span>
             It became less of a moral
                positive now - you go to Facebook to write some code and then you go
                home.
            </span>

          </ul>

             The
                internet was a great place to share information and connect with

           Between 2006 and 2010,
              Google had maintained a censored Google Search, but was heavily
              criticized.

           Google Search was then
              uncensored because of "Chinese government efforts to limit free
              speech, block websites and hack Google computer systems"

           Dragonfly in China would
              establish a precedent that makes it harder for Google to deny other
              countries similar concessions.

           Providing the Chinese
              government with ready access to user data, as required by Chinese law,
              would make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.
