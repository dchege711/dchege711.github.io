## [(April 2018) An Apology for the Internet](https://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/2506.html)

[![Link to the Apology for the Internet Comic because I'm not a bandwidth bandit](/assets/seasons_in_the_sun_snippet.png)](https://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/2506.html)

Remember 'Seasons in the Sun'? I thought it was Westlife's but turns out Terry Jacks is the real owner. Combine that melody and some witty criticism of current technological trends and you get Joy of Tech's comic. Cheers to more cat memes in the sun. Also, [relevant XKCD!](https://xkcd.com/676/)

## [Burrito Time by Dos Toros](https://burritotime.co/)

As much as I advocate for not being glued to the phone, it's hard to hate the brilliant marketing: *one notification sent every day at a random time. First ten to open get free burritos.* That I went ahead to discover their 2011 music video ([Guac It Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-bGJoRb9A)) shows their cool-kid approach is working.

## [Photoshop-for-Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Voco)

In 2016, Adobe's Project Voco had a simple premise: [give me 20min of any person's voice, and I'll be able to put words in their mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3l4XLZ59iw). Voco is no longer in active development. [WaveNet](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) has a research bent, so I'm not too worried about it. But [Lyrebird](https://lyrebird.ai/) is a startup that needs to sell something. There is [fair criticism on faking audio](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lyrebird?utm_campaign=1315_2018-08-27&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Product+Hunt&utm_term=editorial) especially since we also have [video reenactment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk) and [deep fakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) and for good reason. We've not been able to handle textual fake news. There's good chance that watermarking will not curb fake video/audio. That said, we can't really put science on hold to wait for everyone to practise healthy skepticism. Godspeed.
