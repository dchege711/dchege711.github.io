    <p>
        I recently downloaded citations data from <cite><a href="#aminer-citation">
        Aminer</a></cite> without a clear purpose for doing so. Legend has it that some 
        arcane graph algorithm will unequivocally point out all that's fixable 
        in academia. For now, I'll ask the question: <em>Which are the 3 most
        influential academic publications?</em> The 6.3GB database is as follows:
    </p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <th>Table</th><th>Columns</th><th>Remarks</th>
        </thead>
        <tr>
            <td>papers</td>
            <td>paper_id, title, venue, year, number of citations, abstract</td>
            <td>3,079,007 papers from 1936 to 2018</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>authors</td>
            <td>name, appearance order, paper_id</td>
            <td>1,766,547 distinct names (out of 9,476,165 names)</td>
        </tr>
    
        <tr>
            <td>paper_references</td>
            <td>paper_id, cited_paper_id</td>
            <td>25,166,994 references</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Approach 1: Count the number of citations</h2>
    
    <p>
        For one, we can answer that with a SQL query: 
        <pre><code>SELECT papers.* FROM papers ORDER BY papers.n_citation DESC LIMIT 3;</code></pre>
    </p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Number of Citations</th><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>My Remarks</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>73,362</td>
                <td>Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning</td>
                <td>1989</td>
                <td>
                    I never joined the hype train. Maybe it's not too late to hop on. 
                    I don't have a good idea when genetic algorithms are best suited for problems.

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>42,508</td>
                <td>Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints</td>
                <td>2004</td>
                <td>
                    Yeah, should have taken COS 429. The abstract reads vaguely familiar.
                    See <a href="#abstract-distinctive-image-features">abstract</a>.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>34,288</td>
                <td>Bowling alone: the collapse and revival of American community</td>
                <td>2000</td>

                    Haha <a href="http://old.reddit.com/r/2meirl4meirl/">/r/2meirl4meirl</a> 
                    made it to academic circles! See <a href="#abstract-bowling-alone">abstract</a>.

    <p>
        Huh, <cite><a href="#aminer-citation">Aminer's</a></cite> dataset is incomplete. 
        I expected to find <cite><a href="#lowry-citation">
        Protein Measurement With the Folin Phenol Reagent</a></cite>, which according 
        to <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224#/">Nature</a>, 
        had garnered 305,000 citations by 2014. Nonetheless, this blog post must go on.

    <h2>Approach 2: PageRank</h2>

    <p>
        Counting the number of citations is cool and all, but let's try using 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Google's PageRank
        algorithm</a>. PageRank is appropriate because not all links have the 
        same weight. Understandably, I'm not the first to apply it - <cite>
            <a href="senanayake_citation">Senanayake et. al.</a>
        </cite> used PageRank to develop a better index than the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">Hirsch Index</a> for 
        quantifying the impact of the publications of a scholar. However, I'm 
        interested in finding interesting papers (not scholars) to read during 
        my free time now that I'm momentarily done with school 
        <a href="#fermat_note">[note]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wikipedia discusses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#Implementation">
        implementation of PageRank that uses an adjacency matrix</a>. Given that 
        there are 3,079,007 papers, the adjacency matrix \(M\) would have 
        \(9,480,284,106,049\) entries, and therefore, assuming 4 bytes per float, 
        needs at least \(35,317\) GB. I only have \(16\) GB of RAM, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    <h2>Appendix</h2>

    <ul>
        <li id="abstract-genetic-algorithms">
            From the Publisher:#R##N#This book brings together - in an informal and 
            tutorial fashion - the computer techniques, mathematical tools, and research 
            results that will enable both students and practitioners to apply genetic 
            algorithms to problems in many fields. #R##N##R##N#Major concepts are 
            illustrated with running examples, and major algorithms are illustrated 
            by Pascal computer programs. No prior knowledge of GAs or genetics is 
            assumed, and only a minimum of computer programming and mathematics 
            background is required.
        </li>
        <li id="abstract-distinctive-image-features">
            This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant 
            features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between 
            different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image 
            scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a 
            substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition 
            of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, 
            in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high 
            probability against a large database of features from many images. 
            This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object 
            recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to 
            a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor 
            algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging 
            to a single object, and finally performing verification through 
            least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to 
            recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion 
            while achieving near real-time performance.

            BOWLING ALONE warns Americans that their stock of "social capital", 
            the very fabric of their connections with each other, has been 
            accelerating down. Putnam describes the resulting impoverishment of 
            their lives and communities. Drawing on evidence that includes nearly 
            half a million interviews conducted over a quarter of a century in 
            America, Putnam shows how changes in work, family structure, age, 
            suburban life, television, computers, women's roles and other 
            factors are isolating Americans from each other in a trend whose 
            reflection can clearly be seen in British society. We sign 30 
            percent fewer petitions than we did ten years ago. Membership in 
            organisations- from the Boy Scouts to political parties and the 
            Church is falling. Ties with friends and relatives are fraying: 
            we're 35 percent less likely to visit our neighbours or have dinner 
            with our families than we were thirty years ago. We watch sport 
            alone instead of with our friends. A century ago, American citizens' 
            means of connecting were at a low point after decades of urbanisation, 
            industrialisation and immigration uprooted them from families and 
            friends. That generation demonstrated a capacity for renewal by 
            creating the organisations that pulled Americans together. 
            Putnam shows how we can learn from them and reinvent common enterprises 
            that will make us secure, productive, happy and hopeful.
