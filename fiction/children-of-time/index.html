get in film & movies.</p></div></div><p>&ldquo;This is where mankind takes its next great step.&rdquo; [&mldr;] She almost went on
with the line about them becoming gods, but that was for her only. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The whole <em>point</em> of civilization is that we exceed the limits of nature,
you tedious little primitives. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Let the Non Ultra Natura preach their dismal all-eggs-in-one-basket creed of
human purity and supremacy. We will out-evolve them. We will leave them behind.
This will be the first of a thousand worlds that we will give life to. For we
are gods, and we are lonely, so we shall create&mldr; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The muffled banging was more insistent, but the pod only had room for one. Her
heart had always been hard, but she found that she had to harden it still
further, and not think of all those names and faces, her loyal colleagues, that
she and Sering between them were condemning to an explosive end. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Had the entire human race been exterminated save for her, or had it simply been
thrown back into a new dark age, where the dumb brute people looked up at those
moving lights in the sky and forgot that their ancestors had built them. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>It seemed to be Lain&rsquo;s turn to find the silence awkward, but she was a practical
woman. She simply got up to go. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>&ldquo;Return to Earth is not possible. Please may we speak to your sister again,
Eliza?&rdquo;, pleading for the life of humanity in a dead language &ndash; having to make
the call between artificial intransigence and what he was increasingly sure was
real human crazy. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Her expression should have curdled into contempt &ndash; stating the obvious when
every word might count &ndash; but instead she just shrugged. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>A while life inside these boxes. And what? And <em>children</em>? Can you
imagine? Generations of ice-dwellers, forgetting and forgetting who we ever
were, wasting away and never seeing the sun except as just another star. Tending
vats and eating mulch and putting out doomed generations who could never amount
to anything, while <em>you</em> &ndash; all you glorious star-travellers &ndash; get to
sleep wrapped in your no-time, and wake up two hundred years later as if it&rsquo;s
just the next day? And when <em>you</em> woke up, all of you <em>chosen</em> who
weren&rsquo;t condemned to the ice, we&rsquo;d be dead. We&rsquo;d be generations dead, all of us.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The mutineers are especially bitter about time being stolen from them &ldquo;for the
greater good&rdquo;. This contrasts with ants in the colonies that do not have a sense
of self; the ant colony survives at the expense of some of its individuals:</p><blockquote><p>The advancing colony will meet these dangers as it meets all dangers, by
sacrificing enough of itself to nullify them, with the main thrust of its
attack barely slowing. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p></blockquote></div></div><p>&ldquo;What would happen if an asteroid was going to hit us in the side?&rdquo; Holsten
asked. Lain gave him a look that said eloquently, <em>And that&rsquo;s what important
right now?</em> &ldquo;The odds are vanishingly unlikely. It wasn&rsquo;t
resource-effective.&rdquo; &ldquo;To protect the entire human race?&rdquo; Nessel demanded, more
as a jab at Lain than anything else. &ldquo;The <em>Gil</em> was designed by
engineers, not philosophers.&rdquo; Isa Lain shrugged &ndash; or as much as she could will
her hands still secured. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Someone was sobbing and Holsten envied them, because he himself was having a
hard time just drawing breath. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>All he could think was that his own people, an emergent culture that had clawed
its way back to its feet after the ice, was nothing but a shadow of that former
greatness. It was not simply that the <em>Gilgamesh</em> and all their current
space effort was cobbled together from bastardized, half-understood pieces of
the ancient&rsquo;s world&rsquo;s vastly superior technology. It was <em>everything</em>:
from the very beginning his people had known they were inheriting a used world.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Holsten&rsquo;s people had thought themselves lucky that someone had built such a
convenient flight of steps back up from the dark into the sunlight of
civilization. They had never quite come to the realization that those steps led
only to that one place. <em>Who knows what we might have achieved, had we not
been so keen to recreate all their follies. Could we have saved the Earth? Would
we be living there now on our own green planet?</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>This was not showmanship or a desire for suspense, simply that Vitas considered
herself a pure scientist first and foremost, and would report positive and
negative results with equal candor without judging the value or desirability of
the outcome. Holsten was familiar with that particular academic school, which
had grown more and more popular towards the end of Earth, as positive results
became harder to find. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The more he learned of them, the more he saw them not as spacefaring godlike
exemplars, as his culture had originally cast them, but as monsters: clumsy,
bickering, short-sighted monsters. [&mldr;] The shining example of the Old Empire
had tricked Holsten&rsquo;s entire civilization into the error of mimicry. In trying
to <em>be</em> the ancients, they had sealed their own fate &ndash; neither to reach
those heights, nor any others, doomed instead to a history of mediocrity and
envy. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>There had been those back on Earth who claimed the universe cared, and that the
survival of humanity was important, destined, <em>meant</em>. They had mostly
stayed behind, holding to their corroding faith that some great power would
weigh in on their behalf if only things became so very bad. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><h2 id=snapshots-from-evolving-fauna-storyline>Snapshots from Evolving Fauna Storyline</h2><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I wish I had encountered a similar story back in 2012 when covering evolution
in high school biology. It took me a while to appreciate that populations, and
not individuals, evolve.</p></div></div><p>Past individuals of her species might have decided that the little male was a
safer lunch than the Scytodes, and made plans accordingly, but now something
changes&mldr; She does not quite grasp that he is <em>something like her</em>, but
her formidable ability to calculate strategies has gained a new dimension. A new
category appears that expands her options a hundredfold: <em>ally</em>. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>A sense of self and the ability to contemplate the universe are not necessarily
survival traits in and of themselves. Portia is a rare exception &ndash; though not
the only exception &ndash; where increased cognitive capacity granted an immediate
and compelling advantage. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Portia understands that their celestial journeys are predictable enough to use
when navigating her own. One, though, is special. One light does not tread a
slow and year-long course over the heavens, but hurries past, a genuine
traveller just as she is. Portia looks up now and sees that tiny glint of
reflected light passing overhead, a solitary motile speck in the vast dark, and
she feels a kinship with it, lending to that orbiting pinpoint as much of an
arachnomorphic personality as she can conceive of. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>From the microscopic point of view of the nanovirus, Portia and every other
affected species on the planet are merely vectors for the onward transmission of
the virus&rsquo;s own evolving genes. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I think this is a core thesis of Richard Dawkins' gene-centered view of
evolution. The genes are not selfish per-say; rather, the genes that are passed
on are the ones whose evolutionary consequences serve their own implicit
interest in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SelfishGeneWiki></a></span></p></div></div><p>There is no hive mind, but there is a vast and flexible biological difference
engine, a self-perfecting machine dedicated to the continuance of itself. It
does not understand how what it does functions, but it constantly expands its
behavioral repertoire and builds upon those trial-end-error paths that prove
fruitful. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Their constant exploration of possibilities has resulted in this solitary
contact with something vast and intangible, and the colony processes the
information it receives and attempts to find a purpose for it, more and more of
its biological processing power being applied to the task, more and more ants
quivering under the pulsed rhythms of a distant radio signal. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The innate, virus-hardwired Understanding of these mathematical transformations
that she inherited did not inspire her in the same way as being guided through
the sequences by her teachers, slowly coming to the revelation that what these
apparently arbitrary strings of figures described was something beyond mere
invention &ndash; was a self-evident and internally consistent universal truth. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Portia spins and unravels and spins, soothing away the trepidation consuming
her, and replacing it with the undeniable certainty that there is <em>more</em>.
Whatever happens this dat, even if she should fall beneath the iron-clad
mandibles of her foes, there is a depth to life beyond the simple dimensions
that she can perceive and calculate in, and so&mldr; who knows? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The practice is covertly overlooked &ndash; girls will be girls, after all &ndash; but
overtly frowned upon. Killing a male, sanctioned or not, is a world apart from
killing a beast. Even as the fang strikes, the killer and the slain know
themselves to be part of a grander whole. The nanovirus speaks, each to each.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>They gaze up at the Messenger in its fleet passage across the sky, and they see
an entity that speaks to them in mathematical riddles that are aesthetically
appealing to a species that has inherited geometry as the cornerstone of its
civilization. They do not conceive of it as some celestial spider-god that will
reach down into their green world and save them from the ant tide. However, the
message <em>is</em>. The Messenger <em>is</em>. These are facts, and those facts
are the doorway to an invisible, intangible world of the unknown. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>After all, the ants work by nature. They have no inclination or capacity to
consider the wider philosophy of life, and so such opportunity would be wasted
on them. From the point of view of the ant colonies, they prosper as best they
can, given the peculiarly artificial environment they find themselves enmeshed
in. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>There is a constant current of workers coursing through the tunnels, removing
waster and the bodies of the dead, and the corridors themselves shift and
realign to regulate the fortress&rsquo;s internal temperature and airflow. It is a
castle of sliding walls and sudden oubliettes. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Imagine that most of the ways the ants know about the world, all the ways that
they act and react, and most importantly the way that their actions spur other
ants on to action, are a web &ndash; a very complex web. We have unravelled and
consumed that web entirely. We have left them without structure or instruction.
[&mldr;] I am weaving them a new structure. They will follow the lead of our own
ants now. I have given them new minds, and henceforth they are our allies. We
have an army of soldiers. We have devised a weapon to defeat the ants, no matter
how many of them there are, and make them our allies. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Over generations, this view &ndash; that a test has been set beyond the simple, pure
manipulation of numbers &ndash; will gain in popularity, whilst simultaneously being
viewed as a kind of heresy. The events themselves seem inarguable, however.
Something fell, and now it is a blackened shell of metals and other unknown
materials that defy analysis. Something else came to earth, and then returned to
the sky. Most crucially, there were living things. There were giants that came
from the sky. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Its behavior was strange and complex, but it seemed mute, producing no kind of
gesture or vibration that could be considered an attempt at speech. Some noted
that when it opened and closed its mouth, a cleverly designed web could catch a
curious murmur, the same that might be felt when objects were pounded together.
It was a vibration that travelled through the air, rather than across a strand
or through the ground. For some time this was hypothesized as a means of
communication, provoking much intelligent debate, but in the end the absurdity
of such an idea won out. After all, using the same orifice for eating and
communication was manifestly too inefficient. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Portia is aware that other scientists &ndash; even priestess-scientists &ndash; have been
experimenting with some means of reproducing the invisible vibrations by which
the message is spread. Publicly, the Temple cannot condone such meddling of
course, but the spiders are a curious species, and those who are drawn to the
Temple are the most curious of all. It was inevitable that the hothouse flower
of heresy would end up nurtured by those very guardians of the orthodox. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class="comment open-comment"><p>Similar to the girls-will-be-girls sentiment, I find the unspoken common
knowledge fascinating. Are there parallels of these in my current life? How does
one know that a piece of knowledge of widely but secretly held?</p></div></div><p>The Temple old guard, the priestesses of the former generation, hold the message
sacrosanct and perfect. The path of Portia&rsquo;s people is to better appreciate it,
to learn the hidden depths of the message that have yet to be unlocked. It is
not for them to try and howl into the darkness to attract the Messenger&rsquo;s
attention. Passing overhead, the Messenger observes all. There is an order to
the universe, and the Messenger is proof of that. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The old guard seem to subscribe to some aspect of Deism, of a god who does not
interfere with their creation. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#DeismWiki></a></span></p></div></div><p>Violas&rsquo;s studies are in another language still, inexpertly rendered in that
knotwork script. In her writings, she calls it the language of the body. She
explains that every spider&rsquo;s body contains this writing, and that it varies from
individual to individual, but not randomly. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>There is a deeper book. Viola identifies it, There is a second book in a second
code, short and yet full of information, and different, so different. I asked
Viola what it was. She says it is the Messenger within us. She says the
Messenger is always to be found when new Understandings are laid down. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>She grasped that whatever that alien, artificial tangle of language is doing, it
has a divine function: drawing them out of the bestial and into the sublime. It
is the hand that places Understandings within the mind and tissue of life, so
that each generation may become greater than the last. <em>So that we may know
you</em>, Portia reflects, as she watches that far away light arc across the
sky. It seems self-evident now that Bianca has been right all this time. Of
course the Messenger is waiting for their reply. This was heresy such a short
time ago, but Portia has since looked within herself. <em>Why should we be made
thus, to improve and improve, unless it is to aspire?</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>It is hard to say which scientist was first to the mark: it is one of those
ideas that seems simultaneously to be everywhere, exciting every enquiring mind.
Portia&rsquo;s treatment has allowed living adult spiders to benefit from a foreign
Understanding. Yes, what was transferred was an immunity, but surely the process
would work with other Understandings, if they can only be separated out and
their page noted in Viola&rsquo;s great book of the body. No longer will the spread of
knowledge be held down by the slow march of generations or by laborious
teaching. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The replies to the Messenger&rsquo;s mathematical problems &ndash; that every spider knows
and understands &ndash; are ready for transmission. They wait for the Messenger to
appear in the night sky above, and then they send that unequivocal first
transmission. <em>We are here.</em> Within a second of the last solution being
sent, the Messenger ceases its own transmissions, throwing the whole of Portia&rsquo;s
civilization into a panic that their hubris has angered the universe. Several
fraught days later, the Messenger speaks again. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Meeting your Maker is a monumental achievement. How have other authors described
this event?</p><p><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/animal-man-1988-1995/>Grant Morrison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Animal Man&rdquo;</a>

Animal Man confront Morrison about how his life and that of other characters
were frivolously treated by Morrison. This was a more rebellious contact moment.</p></div></div><p>For a recursive, untimed moment, the systems of the Sentry Pod &ndash; the sea of
calculation that boiled behind the human mask of Eliza &ndash; were unable to make a
decision. Too much had been lost, misfiled, edited out of existence within its
mind. It attacked the discontinuities within its own systems. Whilst it was not
truly a self-aware artificial intelligence, it nevertheless knew itself. It
restored itself, worked around insoluble problems, reached the right conclusion
by estimate and circuitous logic. It did its best to awaken Avrana Kern. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Tell them this: I am your creator. I am your god. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This being the first response would spark some rebellion in me in a quest to
become equals. This god is egotistical. Never meet your gods?</p></div></div><p>Not long ago, it seemed that time was becoming something that happened to other
people &ndash; or, as other people had then been in short supply, to other parts of
the universe. Time was a weight that he seemed to have been cut free from. He
stepped in and out of the forward path of its arrow, and was somehow never
struck down. [&mldr;] Now, in his cell, time weighed him down and dragged at his
heels, chaining him to the grindingly slow pace of the cosmos where before he
had leapt ahead across the centuries, skipping between the bright points of
human history. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>He&rsquo;s been up and about for maybe fifty years, on and off. He told his cultists
he was God, and when he woke up next time they told him he was God, and that
little loop has gone round and round until he himself believes it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>The greatest of the spider clans dwell in the mid-level &ndash; shielded from the
extremes of weather, but suitably distant from the lowly ground where those
females without a peer group might fight for leg-room with a swarm of
half-savage feral males. In between the peer houses are the workshops of
artisans who produce that dwindling stock of items that ants cannot be bred to
manufacture, the studios of artists who weave and craft elegant knot-script, and
the laboratories of scientists of a score of disciplines. Beneath the ground,
amongst the roots, crawl the interlocking network of ants, each nest to its own
specialized task. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Portia&rsquo;s people inherited a creation myth, and had their destiny dictated to
them by a being of a power and an origin that passed all their understandings.
The Messenger was the last survivor of an earlier age of the universe, they were
told. In the final throes of that age, it was the Messenger who was chosen to
come to this world and engender life out of the barren earth. The Messenger &ndash;
the Goddess of the green planet &ndash; remade the world so that it would give rise
to that life, next seeded it with plants and trees, and then with the lesser
animals. On the last day of the previous age, at the apex of creation, the
Messenger dispatched Portia&rsquo;s distant ancestors to this world, and settled back
to await their voices. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>A unity of religion has led to a rivalry and factionalism between the nests. In
all their long histories they have worked together, kindred nodes on a
world-spanning continuum. Now divine attention has become a resource that they
must squabble for. Of course Great Nest is preeminent amongst the foremost
favorites of God, with its own knot of frequencies with which it monopolizes
much of the message. Pilgrims of other nests must come begging for what it is
that God wants. Only those of the inner temple are uncomfortable aware that the
message they distribute to those petitioners is merely a best guess. God is at
once specific and obscure. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>If the meanest female is killed, that is a matter for investigation and
punishment, just as if someone were to damage the common ground of the city or
to speak out against the temple. If I am killed, then the only crime the
perpetrator commits is to displease you. [&mldr;] I know it will not happen, so
long as I retain your favor. But I am concerned that it <em>can</em> happen,
that such things are permitted. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>I have seen the face of the Messenger, and measured and studied it as it passes
above. I have set out my plates and analyzed the light that it seems to shed.
Light reflected from the sun only. And the mystery is that there is no mystery.
I can tell you the size and speed of the Messenger. I can even guess at what it
is constructed from. The Messenger is a rock of metal, no more. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Bianca is having her Copernicus moment challenging the Church.</p></div></div><p>&ldquo;You are of value,&rdquo; Portia insists. &ldquo;You are a male of exceptional ability, one
to be celebrated, to be protected and encouraged to prosper. What have you ever
been denied that you have asked for?&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Portia disagrees vehemently. &ldquo;If they were of any quality or calibre, then they
would ascend by their own virtues.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not if there was no structure that they
could possibly climb. Not if all the structure that exists was designed to
disenfranchise them. Portia, I could have been killed. You yourself said it. I
could have been taken by some starving female, and nothing in that would have
been seen as wrong, save that it might anger you.&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>In and of itself, my new architecture carries no instructions, no commands. It
sets the ants no tasks or behaviors. A secondary architecture can be distributed
to the colony, to work within the primary. And another, and another. A colony
could be given a new task instantly, and its members would change with the speed
of the scent as it passes from ant to ant. Different castes could be made
receptive to different instructions, allowing the colony to pursue multiple
tasks all at once. A single colony could follow sequences of separate tasks
without the need for lengthy reconditioning. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>A life lived entirely at the whim of another is no life at all. He has always

fed a narrow range of lies that had slowly locked their faces into expressions
of desperate tranquility, as though to admit to the despair and deprivation that
so clearly weighed on them would risk losing them the favour of God. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Holsten felt himself coming adrift, cut loose from any emotional anchor. He had
found a point where he could look forward &ndash; future-wards &ndash; and see nothing
that he could possibly want, no hoped-for outcome that was remotely conceivable.
He felt as though he had reached the end of all useful time. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Do you think any of this would have happened without me? Do you understand how
important having a single vision is? This isn&rsquo;t something to delegate to some
committee; this is the survival of the human race. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Great Nest denounces its weaker neighbors as straying from the purity of the
message, and claims for itself the right to take whatever steps it must, to put
into effect the will of God. Transmissions from the Messenger, though always
obscure and open to interpretation, are taken to endorse Great Nest&rsquo;s
proclamation. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>They are performing that oldest of tricks: constructing a path by which to reach
a destination, only in this case the destination is permanent security. With
each step they take towards it, that security recedes. And, with each step they
take, the cost of progressing towards such security grows, and the actions
required to move forward become more and more extreme.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The gradual rise of extremism, and its justification.</p></div></div><p>Another task that ant colonies will perform without special conditioning is to
fight unfamiliar ants, and a mining colony is no match for an invading army
column equipped with special castes and technologies. In two months of hard
warfare, not a spider has died, but their insect servants have been slaughtered
in their thousands. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>&ldquo;I want the right to live,&rdquo; he tells them, as firmly as he dares. &ldquo;I want the
death of a male to be punishable, just as the death of a female is &ndash; even death
after mating. I want the right to build my own peer house, and to speak for it.&rdquo;
A million-year prejudice stares back at him. The ancient cannibal spider, whose
old instincts still form the shell within which their culture is nestled,
recoils in horror. He sees the conflict within them: tradition against progress,
the known past against the unknown future. They have come so far, as a species;
they have the intellect to break from the shackles of yesterday. But it will be
hard. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>Guyen almost managed it then. Holsten&rsquo;s perception of right and wrong flipped
and flopped, and he found he <em>could</em> look into that grey, dying face and
see the savior of mankind &ndash; a man who had been trained to make tough decisions,
and had made them with regret but without hesitation. [&mldr;] &ldquo;Traitors,&rdquo; Guyen
repeated, as if savouring the word. &ldquo;In the end, they got what they deserved.&rdquo;
The transition from earnest, martyred leader to raving psychopath had simply
happened without any discernible boundary being crossed.<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><p>And then Fabian is lost briefly in a dream of science, where every ant soldier
could be fitted with a radio receiver, and somehow could write its own chemical
architecture according to the urgings of signals sent out over that invisible
web. A colony of ants that could be orchestrated swift as thought &mldr; ? He
trembles at the thought. <em>What could we not do?</em> And it nags at him, and
nags at him, that he has come across such a thought before. And with a sudden
jolt, he realizes that the great project of the Messenger, which Portia and her
fellow zealots have given their all to realize &ndash; the indirect cause of this war
&ndash; could itself be just such a thing. No ants, no chemicals, but that net of
copper would carry impulses just as the radio would, just as the individual ants
in a colony would. And were there not switches, forks, gates of logic &mldr; ? It
seems to him that such a design would have the virtue of speed, yet surely it
could not be as versatile and complex as an ant colony working at full
efficiency? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Tchaikovsky2015></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Shades of the human computer described in the 3 Body Problem. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#3BPHumanComputer></a></span></p></div></div><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=SelfishGeneWiki>The Selfish Gene - Wikipedia<i>.</i></cite>
