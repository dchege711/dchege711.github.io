equal pay and all that garbage&mldr; But I thought you feminists were pacifists,
too.</em> [Alter] <em>Who wants peace, when we have not yet begun to fight?</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-01></a></span></p><p>[Representative Brown] <em>There are only thirteen females in the senate and sixty
in the house&mldr; And almost three-fourths of us are democrats. A few wives of
dead republicans think we&rsquo;re trying to eliminate the two-party system just
because we&rsquo;re not giving them their husbands' seats.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-03></a></span></p><p>[Victoria] <em>I don&rsquo;t know anything about you, Hero. Perhaps you&rsquo;re just another
pro-male interloper, posing as a true daughter of the Amazon. Now kill the
girl&mldr; Or kill yourself.</em> [Hero kills the girl] <em>Well played, love. Believe me,
I despise barking orders like a patriarch. Rest assured, when the game is over,
the Queen and the Pawn go back into the same box. Saddle up, my sisters!
Somewhere out there, the last of our oppressors still lives!</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-05></a></span></p><p>[Alter] <em>As soon as we removed all of Israel&rsquo;s external threats, the internal
conflict that&rsquo;s been simmering for years finally came to a boil. The same will
happen to our allies in the States soon enough. Without an outside &ldquo;evil&rdquo; for
its citizens to hate, poor will eventually turn against rich, white against
black, and&mldr;</em> [Sadie] <em>What are you suggesting, the only way to protect peace
in our nations is to invent a war? What the hell kind of plan is that?</em> [Alter]
<em>A very old, very reliable one.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-13></a></span></p><p>[Ciba, sole survivor of a re-entry into Earth] <em>They kept saying the same thing
over and over&mldr; women and children first.</em> [Dr. Mann] <em>They jeopardized the
future of mankind&mldr; for chivalry?</em> [Ciba] <em>Never. Those two men were the
bravest, most noble&mldr; Doctor, when they said &ldquo;women and children,&rdquo; they meant
it literally.</em> [Dr. Mann] <em>You mean, you&rsquo;re&mldr; You&rsquo;re pregnant? [Ciba] You have
to understand, we were up there for almost a year. We were scared and lonely
and&mldr; And none of us really thought we&rsquo;d make it back alive.</em> [Dr. Mann]
<em>Jesus, which one is the father?</em> [Ciba] <em>I don&rsquo;t know. I loved them both so
much. So fucking much&mldr;</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-15></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The two men aren&rsquo;t presented as noble earlier on in the series. They made jokes
on getting treated like royalty on their return to earth for being the only men
alive. Their selflessness was unexpected.</p></div></div><p>[Cayce] <em>A play about the last man on earth.</em> &mldr; [Henrietta] <em>Is that really
such a good idea, luv? Won&rsquo;t it seem like we&rsquo;re exploiting tragedy for, well&mldr;
the purpose of entertainment?</em> [Cayce] <em>But this will be more than
entertainment! This will be art! We&rsquo;ll be using fiction to&mldr; to help us get to
the truth! It&rsquo;s the perfect story to convey all of the ideas I&rsquo;ve been trying to
get across about life in the post-plague world!</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-16></a></span></p><p><em>Wait, I need to know, does it have a happy ending?</em> [Cayce] <em>Of course, the
last man saves the world.</em> [Yorick in a hazmat suit] <em>Really? How?</em> [Cayce] <em>By
committing suicide and letting the women save themselves.</em> [Yorick] <em>No
offense&mldr; but your play sounds like a piece of shit.</em> [Cayce, after Yorick
leaves] <em>Everyone&rsquo;s a critic&mldr;</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-17></a></span></p><p>[Beth] <em>Anyway, Magdalene Asylums were an Irish-Catholic thing, spiritual
sanctuaries for &ldquo;sinful women.&rdquo; You know&mldr; Prostitutes, abuse victims,
<strong>flirts.</strong> The hilariously named <strong>sisters of mercy</strong> would lock these girls
inside laundries and sweatshops, force them to work under the whip for their
penance. And this wasn&rsquo;t the Dark Ages, mind you. I found out my biological mum
died in one of these hellholes in <strong>fucking 1989.</strong></em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-25></a></span></p><p>[Anna] <em>Tell that to the girls who dread the return of the mutaween police
force, the public lashings, and the &ndash;</em> [Agent 355] <em>Oh, save the white woman&rsquo;s
burden routine. Those girls would <strong>die</strong> to have their fathers and brothers
back, and you know it.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#YTheLastMan-28></a></span></p><h2 id=vocabulary>Vocabulary</h2><p><strong>Pyrrhic</strong>: <em>adjective</em> (of a victory) won at too great a cost to have been
