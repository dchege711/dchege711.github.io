to a tree for saying how great it would be to nice for a change, &mldr; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to
ask him what he was looking so worried about. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Mr. Prosser&rsquo;s accepted role was to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy
such as the For the Public Good talk, or the March of Progress talk, the They
Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other
cajoleries and threats. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Prosser was worried. He thought that one of them wasn&rsquo;t making a lot of sense.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>There&rsquo;s no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and
demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department in
Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you&rsquo;ve had plenty of time to
lodge any formal complaint and it&rsquo;s far too late to start making a fuss about it
now. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>What do you mean, you&rsquo;ve never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven&rsquo;s sake
mankind, it&rsquo;s only four light-years away, you know. I&rsquo;m sorry, but if you can&rsquo;t
be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that&rsquo;s your own lookout.
Energize the demolition beams. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the
Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his
intention to run for President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was ideal
presidency fodder. What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was
doing it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>The President in particular is very much a figurehead &ndash; he wields no real power
whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is
required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged
outrage. For this reason, the President is always a controversial choice, always
an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to
draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the
most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had &ndash; he has already spent two
of his ten presidential years in prison for fraud. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>The argument goes something like this: &ldquo;I refuse to prove that I exist,&rdquo; says
God, &ldquo;for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Man,
&ldquo;the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn&rsquo;t it? It could not have evolved by
chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don&rsquo;t.
QED.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; says God, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; and promptly vanishes in
a puff of logic. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Trilllian had come to suspect that the main reason Zaphod had had such a wild
and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of
anything he did. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>One of the major difficulties Trilllian experience in her relationship with
Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to
get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn&rsquo;t be
bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be
outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he didn&rsquo;t actually understand what was
going on, and really being genuinely stupid. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>He never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned
unfathomability into an art form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture
of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to
tell which was which. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the
former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich, and largely tax free. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and
nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor &ndash; at least no one worth
speaking of. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Isn&rsquo;t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that
there are fairies at the bottom of it too? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor
innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a
whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>The recession came and we decided it would save a lot of bother if we just slept
through it. So we programmed the computers to revive use when it was all over.
The computers were index-linked to the Galactic stock-market prices, you see, so
that we&rsquo;d all be revived when everyone else had rebuilt the economy enough to
afford our rather expensive services. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more
intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much &ndash; the wheel, New
York, wars and so on &ndash; while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in
the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed
that they were far more intelligent than man &ndash; for precisely the same reasons.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated
attempt to do a double-backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the
&ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; but in fact the message was this: <em>So long and thanks
for all the fish.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at
and what the shapes represented while another quite sensibly refused to
countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in
that direction. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, what&rsquo;s the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may
or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives you his bleeding phone
number the next morning?&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; shouted Vroomfondel, &ldquo;we demand
rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty.&rdquo; <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Never again will we wake up in the morning and think <em>Who am I? What is my
purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don&rsquo;t get up
and go to work?</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>I checked it thoroughly, and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the
problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you&rsquo;ve never actually known what
the question is. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>Well, I mean, <em>yes</em> idealism, <em>yes</em> the dignity of pure research, <em>yes</em> the
pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I&rsquo;m afraid you begin
to suspect that if there&rsquo;s <em>any</em> real truth, it&rsquo;s that the entire
multidimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being ran by a
bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten
million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and
running, then I for one could do with the exercise. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>That&rsquo;s excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to
meaning anything at all. <em>How many roads must a man walk down? Forty two.</em>
Excellent, excellent, that&rsquo;ll fox &lsquo;em. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><p>The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three
distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry, and
Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. For instance,
the first phase is characterized by the question <em>How can we eat?</em> the second by
the question <em>Why do we eat?</em> and the third by the question <em>Where shall we have
lunch?</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Adams1979></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-book" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=Adams1979>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy<i>.</i></cite>
