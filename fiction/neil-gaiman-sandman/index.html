    <div class="comment"><p>Path to comic: Lucifer (Netflix) -&gt; Lucifer (Comic) -&gt; The Sandman (Comic)</p>
<p>Netflix is also adapting the comic, so interested in how it deviates from the
source. Ser Brienne of Tarth will be Lucifer. Hype! <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiSandmanTV"></a></span></p>

<h2 id="love">Love</h2>
<p>Dream: <em>Sister &ndash; you know how I felt for Nada one. What I feel for her still.
But she defied me. I gave her due earning, and she still spurned me, so&hellip;</em>
Death: <em>So you sentenced her to hell.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1990-11"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I like it when the main character is also flawed. In this case, Morpheus sending
Nada to hell was unfair.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>[Eve] <em>God created her for Adam out of nothingness. Bones first. Then internal
organs. Then flesh. Muscle. Sinew. Fat. Bile. Eyes. Snot. Skin. Hair. Breath&hellip;
Adam couldn&rsquo;t bear to go near her. He wouldn&rsquo;t touch her. &ldquo;He saw her full of
secretions and blood.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what the midrash states. [&hellip;] Opinions differ.
Most say God destroyed her. A few have claimed that she was permitted to leave
the garden. Alone. Then it was that God put Adam to sleep, took a rib from his
side, and from it created Eve. Only when she was complete did Adam wake. He saw
Eve, finished and perfect, and took her to wife.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1992-40"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Adam is portrayed as mostly blameless in the Bible. Gaiman&rsquo;s Sandman universe
recasts him as imperfect, e.g. rejecting the more self-assured Lilith, and now
rejecting the second woman.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>[Mervyn] <em>Now, guys like me, ordinary Joes, we just shrug our shoulders, say,
hey, that&rsquo;s life, flick it if you can&rsquo;t take a joke. Not him. Oh no. He&rsquo;s gotta
be the tragic figure standing out in the rain, mournin' the loss of his beloved.
So down comes the rain, right on cue. In the meantime everybody gets dreams
fulla existential angst and wakes up feeling like hell. And we all get wet.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1992-42"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="dreams">Dreams</h2>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Urania Blackwell is a metamorphae (made into one by Ra) who wants to die.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Urania Blackwell: <em>I only have two kinds of dreams: the bad and the terrible.
Bad dreams I can cope with. They&rsquo;re just nightmares, and they end eventually.
The terrible dreams are the good dreams. In my terrible dreams, everything&rsquo;s
fine. I&rsquo;m still with the company. I still look like me. None of the last five
years ever happened. Sometimes I&rsquo;m married. Once I even had kids. I even knew
their names. Everything&rsquo;s wonderful and normal and fine. And then I wake up, and
I&rsquo;m still me. And I&rsquo;m still here. And that is truly terrible.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1990"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Typically, nightmares are the bad dreams. But that bears an implicit assumption
that the dreamer&rsquo;s waking life is desirable. Urania flips this script.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Death: <em>When the first thing existed, I was there, waiting. When the last
living thing dies, my job will be finished. I&rsquo;ll put the chairs on the, turn out
the lights and lock the universe behind me when I leave.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1990"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>The end of the universe is a tantalizing topic. What happens in the end? Gaiman
explores a linear universe with an end in sight. Others claim a cyclic universe,
where the end of one universe births another. Both interpretations make for
interesting fiction, e.g. Galactus being a remnant of a previous universe <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiGalactus"></a></span>.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Dream: <em>He heard long ago, in a dream, that one day every century Death takes on
mortal flesh, better to comprehend what the lives she takes must feel like, to
taste the bitter tang of mortality: that this is the price she must pay for
being the divider of the living from all that has gone before, all that must
come after. He broods on this tale, but has never questioned her about its
truth. Perhaps he fears that she would answer him.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1990-11"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Second time I&rsquo;m encountering the idea of immortals assuming mortal lives for
empathy. Christianity has God living a human life as Jesus.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>[Sexton] If they never existed, who are the people in the photographs?
[Death] That&rsquo;s just the universe&rsquo;s way of making me feel more comfortable.
Technically right now I&rsquo;m about three hours old. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Death01"></a></span></p>

<h2 id="evil">Evil</h2>
<p>Lucifer: <em>&ldquo;The Devil made me do it.&rdquo; I have never made one of them do anything.
Never. They live their own tiny lives. I do not live their lives for them. And
then they die, and they come here (having traversed against what they believed
to be right), and expect us to fulfill their desire for pain and retribution. I
don&rsquo;t make them come here.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1991-02"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Aside the idea that the Devil doesn&rsquo;t cause evil in the world, going to hell for
self-punishment is unsettling, e.g. a guilt-free murderer doesn&rsquo;t go to hell.
Goes against the more comforting idea of a supreme entity (God) who fairly
judges all.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The Creator [through Remiel]: <em>Hell is Heaven&rsquo;s reflection. It is Heaven&rsquo;s
shadow. They define each other. Reward and Punishment; hope and despair. There
must be a Hell, for without Hell, Heaven has no meaning. And thus Hell must be.</em>
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1991-06"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="power-and-tyranny">Power and Tyranny</h2>
<p>St-Just: <em>We are remaking the world, woman; we are creating an age of pure
reason. We have taken the names of dead gods and kings from the days of the week
and the months of the year. We have lost the saints and burnt the churches. I
myself have inaugurated a new religion, based on reason, celebrating an
egalitarian supreme being, distant and uninvolved.</em>
<span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1991-08"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1991-08"></a></span> is set in the French Revolution where the
revolutionaries, after killing the aristocrats, are now going after the remnants
of magic, because that goes against the new religion of reason.</p>
<p>The revolutionaries are presented as being a shade of grey, instead of being
all-good. Is it misinformed to quip, &ldquo;Bring back the guillotines!&rdquo; in
discussions about the society&rsquo;s elite?</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Caeser Augustus: <em>But you should fear me. Not because I&rsquo;m fast. And I am fast.
And not because I&rsquo;m strong. And I am strong. But because if I gave the word
tonight, you would disappear, and no one would even date to mention that you had
ever existed. And no one would dare complain. Because the alternative to me is
chaos.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1991-09"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Hypothesis on how some tyrants commit atrocities, and no one bats an eye.</p>
<p>On a matter of linguistic style, Augustus&rsquo;s dialogue has a rhythm to it.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>[Ishtar] <em>Once in every great year, the sacred king would see me dance. It was
the last thing he ever saw. It was said no man would ever desire to see anything
more, once he had seen me dance. I know how gods begin, Rodger. We start off as
dreams. Then we walk out of dreams into the land. We are worshipped and loved,
and take power to ourselves. And then one day there&rsquo;s no one left to worship us.
And in the end, each little god and goddess takes its last journey back into
dreams&hellip; And what comes after, not even we know. I&rsquo;m going to dance now, I&rsquo;m
afraid.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1992-45"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><em>October knew, of course, that the action of turning a page, of ending a chapter
or shutting a book, did not end a tale. Having admitted that, he would also avow
that happy endings were never difficult to find: &ldquo;It is simply a matter,&rdquo; he
explained to April, &ldquo;of finding a sunny place in a garden, where the light is
golden and the grass is soft; somewhere to rest, to stop reading, and to be
content.</em></p>

ones who came after you, who froze the world into rigid patterns.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1992-39"></a></span></p>
<p>[Girl] <em>So what I want to know is, when I&rsquo;m asleep, do I really remember how to
fly? And forget how when I wake up? Or am I just dreaming that I can fly?</em>
[Dream] <em>When you dream, sometimes you remember. When you wake, you always
forget.</em> [Girl] <em>But that&rsquo;s not fair&hellip;</em> [Dream] <em>No.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Gaiman1992-43"></a></span></p>
