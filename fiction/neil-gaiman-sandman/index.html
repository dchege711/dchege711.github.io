Death: <em>So you sentenced her to hell.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1991-21></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I like it when the main character is also flawed. In this case, Morpheus sending
Nada to hell was unfair.</p></div></div><p>[Eve] <em>God created her for Adam out of nothingness. Bones first. Then internal
organs. Then flesh. Muscle. Sinew. Fat. Bile. Eyes. Snot. Skin. Hair. Breath&mldr;
Adam couldn&rsquo;t bear to go near her. He wouldn&rsquo;t touch her. &ldquo;He saw her full of
secretions and blood.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what the midrash states. [&mldr;] Opinions differ.
Most say God destroyed her. A few have claimed that she was permitted to leave
the garden. Alone. Then it was that God put Adam to sleep, took a rib from his
side, and from it created Eve. Only when she was complete did Adam wake. He saw
Eve, finished and perfect, and took her to wife.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1992-40></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Adam is portrayed as mostly blameless in the Bible. Gaiman&rsquo;s Sandman universe
recasts him as imperfect, e.g. rejecting the more self-assured Lilith, and now
rejecting the second woman.</p></div></div><p>[Mervyn] <em>Now, guys like me, ordinary Joes, we just shrug our shoulders, say,
hey, that&rsquo;s life, flick it if you can&rsquo;t take a joke. Not him. Oh no. He&rsquo;s gotta
be the tragic figure standing out in the rain, mournin' the loss of his beloved.
So down comes the rain, right on cue. In the meantime everybody gets dreams
fulla existential angst and wakes up feeling like hell. And we all get wet.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1992-42></a></span></p><p>[John Decker] <em>All I&rsquo;m trying to say is&mldr; who cares if you had some

Bad dreams I can cope with. They&rsquo;re just nightmares, and they end eventually.
The terrible dreams are the good dreams. In my terrible dreams, everything&rsquo;s
fine. I&rsquo;m still with the company. I still look like me. None of the last five
years ever happened. Sometimes I&rsquo;m married. Once I even had kids. I even knew
their names. Everything&rsquo;s wonderful and normal and fine. And then I wake up, and
I&rsquo;m still me. And I&rsquo;m still here. And that is truly terrible.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1990></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Typically, nightmares are the bad dreams. But that bears an implicit assumption
that the dreamer&rsquo;s waking life is desirable. Urania flips this script.</p></div></div><h2 id=death>Death</h2><p><span class=tag-ref><a href=/tags/death-motif>#death-motif</a></span></p><p>Death: <em>When the first thing existed, I was there, waiting. When the last

the lights and lock the universe behind me when I leave.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1990></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The end of the universe is a tantalizing topic. What happens in the end? Gaiman
explores a linear universe with an end in sight. Others claim a cyclic universe,
where the end of one universe births another. Both interpretations make for
interesting fiction, e.g. Galactus being a remnant of a previous universe <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiGalactus></a></span>.</p></div></div><p>Dream: <em>He heard long ago, in a dream, that one day every century Death takes on
mortal flesh, better to comprehend what the lives she takes must feel like, to
taste the bitter tang of mortality: that this is the price she must pay for
being the divider of the living from all that has gone before, all that must
come after. He broods on this tale, but has never questioned her about its
truth. Perhaps he fears that she would answer him.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1991-21></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Second time I&rsquo;m encountering the idea of immortals assuming mortal lives for

Never. They live their own tiny lives. I do not live their lives for them. And
then they die, and they come here (having traversed against what they believed

don&rsquo;t make them come here.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Gaiman1991-23></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Aside the idea that the Devil doesn&rsquo;t cause evil in the world, going to hell for
self-punishment is unsettling, e.g. a guilt-free murderer doesn&rsquo;t go to hell.
Goes against the more comforting idea of a supreme entity (God) who fairly
judges all.</p></div></div><p>The Creator [through Remiel]: <em>Hell is Heaven&rsquo;s reflection. It is Heaven&rsquo;s
shadow. They define each other. Reward and Punishment; hope and despair. There
must be a Hell, for without Hell, Heaven has no meaning. And thus Hell must be.</em>

can be no God. Without either, hell and heaven are much the same place. I
suspect they&rsquo;ll work that out eventually. Once I&rsquo;m gone. There&rsquo;s another truth
too. My father, in His infinite kindness &ndash; or cruelty &ndash; created a circular
universe. Like Bach&rsquo;s endlessly rising canon, it seems to change, but never
truly does. I have no doubt about it. They will drag me back into being. Some
way or other, there will have been a war in heaven. There will have been an
angel who fell. But oh, for that short while, Mazikeen, there will be no me. And
they will go back to the way it was, as it has before and before. But&mldr; for a
short while I will have escaped.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Lucifer-v3-24></a></span></p><h2 id=power-and-tyranny>Power and Tyranny</h2><p>St-Just: <em>We are remaking the world, woman; we are creating an age of pure

dreams. Then we walk out of dreams into the land. We are worshipped and loved,
