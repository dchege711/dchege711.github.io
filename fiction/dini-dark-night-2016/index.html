one&rsquo;s company. But at that age, the last thing a nothing kid wants to be is
lumped in with another nothing. Proof that cruelty, even garbed as
self-preservation, is contagious.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><p>DINI. <em>Was I mad? Sure. Would I have liked to have pounded those guys?
Absolutely. But to us quiet, lonely kids, those moments of spontaneous
righteousness always came too late&mldr; Like when we&rsquo;re slinking home, fighting
back tears and thinking about the defiant remarks we should have made and
the brave actions we could have taken. Besides, when it come to being
colorful, we invisible kids learned to carry our colors on the inside. We let
those colors out when we did things we loved&mldr; drawing, music, acting&mldr; those
things that defined us and made us glow.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><p>DINI. <em>So, you get the idea. In order to survive, I had devised this unique
coping mechanism. I could put up with any sort of mindless torture in public as
long as I could let my imagination run wild in private. Of course, there were
voices of well-meaning dissent.</em><br>GINI&rsquo;S DAD. <em>Cartoons again&mldr; I&rsquo;d like
to know what kind of job you can get by watching cartoons.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><p>DINI. <em>You can think with amazing clarity when you believe you are going to
die. For one thing, I knew no one would help me. If anyone was going to rush to
my aid, they would have done so already. And never mind me calling for help. My
assailants would kill me immediately of that, I was certain. Besides, they
were already yelling loud enough to rouse the neighborhood. Hard to listen
to a couple of huge guys repeatedly screaming, &ldquo;Motherfucking faggot bitch!&rdquo; and
not be a little curious about what&rsquo;s going on outside. People must have
heard, and locked their doors.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The Bystander Effect in panel form.</p></div></div><p>POLICE OFFICER. <em>We&rsquo;ll follow up where we can, see if anyone else has been
attacked in this area. Maybe someone&rsquo;s seen something or knows something.</em><br>GINI. <em>Is there any chance of catching those guys?</em><br>POLICE OFFICER.
<em>L.A.P.D. covers a lot of territory. A few blocks west, in Beverly Hills,
they have their own police department and more manpower to devote to crimes in
their jurisdiction.</em><br>GINI. <em>So I should have asked them to drag me a half
mile that way before they kicked my ass?</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This point came up in several online discussions during the rise of the defund
the police movement. Sometimes the police are spread too thin that for the lone
individual, justice does not prevail.</p></div></div><p>GINI. <em>Everyone is right &ndash; you should have been there for me that night.</em><br>BATMAN. <em>I was there, if you had bothered to think like I do! You
saw them, two figures huddled close together, faces obscured, moving toward
you in a predatory manner!</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><p>GINI. <em>I still had to exit the studio. And every step toward the elevator
brought questions and observations&mldr;</em><br>CO-WORKERS. <em>Does it hurt? Did
anybody see anything? So sorry&mldr; Did the police find anything? Does it hurt?
Right in your neighborhood, too&mldr; Same thing happened to my cousin. Cops did
nothing.<br>BARRY. Were they black?</em><br>GINI. <em>One of them was. The
smaller one, I&rsquo;m not sure. He got behind me quick, Barry, I couldn&rsquo;t really see.
I don&rsquo;t think so.</em><br>BARRY. <em>Damn it.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><p>IVY. <em>You certainly can&rsquo;t blame Regina for sticking to her priorities. In that
regard, she was 100 percent honest. Where you were completely disingenuous,
using the award ceremony to impress the girl while you yourself had so little to
offer. Limited show-business connections, even more limited financial resources,
and as far as physical attraction goes, well&mldr; [&mldr;] Of course, she never
really hated you. Probably didn&rsquo;t like you much either, but my guess is she
rarely thought about you at all. Even that would have required too much
emotional investment. The only hatred you experienced was from yourself.
Because in that moment you looked at yourself and despised what you saw.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Gini did end up with a happy love life later in life. The disingenuousness
expressed here is prevalent in misguided Nice Guysâ„¢. Asserting that the hatred
came from within is a sobering look at this all too common scenario.</p></div></div><p>PENGUIN. <em>Take the concept of justice, for instance. Oh, it&rsquo;s a fine
literary device for comic books, but looking for it in real life is a
recipe for despair. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s good rum to wash away the
disappointment.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><p>GINI. <em>He&rsquo;s shot sky-high and barely manages to clamp his grapple onto a
gargoyle way up on the side of a building. The grapple pulls Batman up, and he
just hangs there, hovering between life and death. Then we&rsquo;re inside the
Dreaming, the Sandman&rsquo;s kingdom. Batman comes to and finds he&rsquo;s in a sort of
negative space. No villains, no Gotham, no pain, for that matter. Nothing
except him and a girl. Death. It seems that Death and the Sandman are
siblings in a sort of dysfunctional family of states of human consciousness.
That part&rsquo;s a little too much for just twenty-two minutes. Anyway, Death
good-naturedly tells &lsquo;the Cheater&rsquo; he&rsquo;s dodged her for the last time. Now
she will finally ease him over to the other side. That&rsquo;s when Morpheus, the
Sandman, appears. He tells his sister that Batman is his guest in his realm, and
asks Death to spare him, for now. Of course, Batman has no idea what these two
are talking about. He only knows that he&rsquo;s in the middle of some insane
dream brought about by his injuries. Death&rsquo;s not happy, but family is
family, so she hands back while Morpheus tells Batman he is responsible for more
dreams than he knows. Dreams of Batman in all forms pervade human minds. Acting
like ghost out of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Morpheus shows Batman how his
image haunts the dreams of the wicked, scaring more than a few of them into
giving up crime. The Sandman also reveals how Batman has instilled dreams of
hope in the people he&rsquo;s saved. In his own way, Batman is a powerful agent of
the Dreaming. These revelations are things that Batman admits he may have felt
on some level, but he&rsquo;s always pushed them aside in his mind in order to
concentrate on his mission. Morpheus tells Batman he stands at a crossroad.
He can follow death to eternal rest, or he can allow Morpheus to wake him.
Neither choice is wrong but only Batman may make the choice. Batman
knows waking means he will have to deal with pain, but he also knows he will
heal. He chooses to live. There is a bright light and Batman recoils in
pain.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#DarkNight></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The Sandman and Batman, two of my favorite characters, in the same story is
