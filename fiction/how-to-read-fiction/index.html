            <p>Imaginative literature primarily pleases rather than teaches. It is much easier
to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know why one is pleased. Beauty is
harder to analyze than truth. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<p>On the fiction&rsquo;s importance, <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span> phrases it nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we could not live in this [real] world if we were not able, from time to
time, to get away from it. We do not mean that imaginative literature is
always, or essentially, escapist. In the ordinary sense of that term, the idea
is contemptible. If we must escape from reality, it should be to a deeper, or
greater, reality.</p>
</blockquote>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Emily St. John Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Station Eleven&rdquo; is set in post-apocalyptic universe,
and follows a group of travelling performers. At first, the concept of doing
plays in a post-apocalyptic world felt like misplaced priorities, but the
travelling performers bring much needed excitement (and escape?) in a world
plagued by loss.</p>

<h2 id="how-not-to-read-fiction">How Not to Read Fiction</h2>
<p>Fiction appeals primarily to the imagination. <em>Don&rsquo;t try to resist the effect
that a work of imaginative literature has on you.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Are there non-conscious forms of resistance? Maybe being distracted &ndash; including
by taking notes about the fiction itself while reading the fiction? But the
effect wears off with time, so I don&rsquo;t think waiting until the end is much
better.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Unlike the expository writer than aims at unambiguous explicitness, the
imaginative writer tries to maximize the latent ambiguities of words in order to
gain all the richness and force inherent in their multiple meanings. The whole
piece says something that none of its words say or can say. <em>Don&rsquo;t look for
terms, propositions, and arguments in imaginative literature.</em> <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>

I enjoyed the whole piece, but couldn&rsquo;t point to specific parts that made like
it. On the whole, seeing through the narrator&rsquo;s eyes, and empathizing with
Meri&rsquo;s character made the piece an immersive read. I have not lived in Meri&rsquo;s
world, but I could imagine it, and live in it through Onjerika.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p><em>Don&rsquo;t criticize fiction by the standards of truth and consistency that properly
apply to communication of knowledge.</em> The piece must be true only in the sense
that it <em>could have happened</em> in the world of characters and events that the
novelist has created, and re-created in us. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Therein lies the dissatisfaction with deus ex machina moments in the plot. As a
reader, I&rsquo;ve done my part by immersing myself into the author&rsquo;s world. There are
constraints that make me cross out certain plot directions. If the author then
proceeds on a course that I had crossed out, I feel cheated. Okay, I&rsquo;m still
salty about Daenerys going ham and razing King&rsquo;s Landing after their surrender.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2 id="structural-rules-for-reading-fiction">Structural Rules for Reading Fiction</h2>
<p>Classify a work of fiction according to its kind, e.g. lyric, novel, play, etc.
For example, unlike a novelist, a playwright can never speak in their own
person. Such differences in manner of writing call for differences in the
reader&rsquo;s receptivity. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<p>Grasp the unity of the whole work, which lies in the plot. Be able to summarize
its plot in a brief narration &ndash; not a proposition or an argument. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<p>Know where the narrative begins, what it goes through, and where it comes out
at. Know the various crises that lead up to the climax, where and how the climax
occurs, and what happens in the aftermath. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="interpretive-rules-for-reading-fiction">Interpretive Rules for Reading Fiction</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve not grasped a story until you are familiar with its characters (and their
thoughts, speeches, feelings, and actions), and until you have lived through its
events. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<p>To find the author&rsquo;s propositions, be an observer immersed in the imaginary
world, and participate in its happenings by sympathetic insight. Have your
finger on the pulse of the narrative and be sensitive to its very beat. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="critical-rules-for-reading-fiction">Critical Rules for Reading Fiction</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t criticize imaginative writing until you fully appreciate what the author
has tried to make you experience. Merely appreciate the fact that the writer
sets their story in, say, Paris, and not object that it would have been better
to set in Minneapolis; but you have the right to criticize what the author does
with the Parisians and with the city itself. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<p>We do not agree or disagree with fiction; we either like it or we do not. The
reasons for liking or disliking have some critical relevance to the work itself,
but in their first expression, they are more likely to be about your preferences
and prejudices. To criticize, objectify your reactions by pointing to those
things in the book that caused them. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Adler1972-14"></a></span></p>
<h2 id="a-hypothetical-browser-extension-for-consuming-fiction">A Hypothetical Browser Extension for Consuming Fiction</h2>
<p>A lot of the imaginative works that I encounter are digital, e.g. stories,
comics, films, TV shows, music albums, etc. These works can be viewed in a
browser, which avails the opportunity for an optimized experience.</p>
<p>Imaginative works tend to have moments that stoke reactions. Waiting till the
end isn&rsquo;t ideal because there can be too many moments to keep track of. On the
other hand, appreciating the moments in time interrupts the flow, and may break
the immersion.</p>
<p>The ideal scenario would be a quick way to capture the context at a given point
in time and flow of the imaginative work. A browser can do that: it has
information about the playback of a video or audio, and in the case of comics,
can capture the screen&rsquo;s content. A browser extension can then use the 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Session_API"

    Media
Session API
     <i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

to avail it in a persistent side panel. When I&rsquo;m done enjoying an imaginative
piece, I can then use the side panel&rsquo;s contextual landmarks to flesh out what I
liked/disliked and why.</p>
<p>Does something like this already exist? The Chrome Web Store has a couple of
options for video content:</p>
<ul>
<li>

    Video Annotation &amp;

temporarily pauses playback to allow annotation. Last updated in Sept 2014.</li>

    PinPoint
     <i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

allows annotation without pausing playback, but seems limited to YouTube
videos. Last updated in Jan 2015.</li>

    >
    Transnote - Video Notes for
YouTube
     <i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

seems functionally equivalent to PinPoint, but its author has a &ldquo;verified&rdquo;
badge, so maybe fewer bugs and/or more data collection? Last updated in June
2020.</li>

    >
    ReClipped: YouTube Notes &amp;
Screenshots
     <i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

is more fully featured, e.g. screenshots, multiple platforms, export notes as
markdown, tagged annotations, etc. Also by a verified author. Significant
ratings: 4.6 (37), +5k users. Last updated in Sept 2022.</li>

    YiNote
     <i class="fas fa-fw fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</a>

is like Transnote, but with a feature for collaborative annotations.
Significant ratings too: 4.3 (120), +10k users. Last updated in Oct 2021.</li>
</ul>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Comes down to ReClipped vs. YiNote, and ReClipped wins out for its focus on the
annotation features. ReClipped doesn&rsquo;t support HBO Max and Netflix, and its
Prime Video doesn&rsquo;t apply to all videos. Can&rsquo;t use it on Hoopla either for comic
books. YiNote works on HBO Max, albeit awkwardly, e.g. inserting a space also
toggles play/pause in the video.</p>
