blanks with beliefs that make the world a more exciting place for them. What
they lack in knowledge, they make up for with conviction.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>LOIS. <em>As Americans, we talk about being <strong>American</strong> as if we all agree on what
that means. But the truth is that some judge <strong>truth</strong> and <strong>justice</strong> by how
well they support the American way. While others judge the <strong>American way</strong> by
how well it stands up for truth and justice. For some, <strong>freedom</strong> is simply the
name they&rsquo;ve given to their way of life. But for others, freedom is what they
call their struggles to <strong>survive.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>BATMAN. <em>Justice is a <strong>lie</strong> we tell others. An unheeded prayer for mercy. The
weak calling for a time-out we&rsquo;ll never grant them. No matter how much we
pretend we&rsquo;re on their side. The truth is&mldr; There is no such thing as
<strong>justice.</strong> But there are, sometimes&mldr; <strong>consequences.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><p>JOKER. <em>Whoever they pray to the one day a week they go to church&mldr; These
squirrelly papers get the other <strong>six.</strong> Each one of these bills&mldr; A prayer to
a <strong>false god.</strong> And <strong>you&mldr;</strong> their high priest.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Joker&rsquo;s nemesis is more organized society than Batman. Granted, society is very

world,</strong> Dad.</em><br>JONATHAN. <em>Save it <strong>quick,</strong> or save it <strong>right?</strong> There&rsquo;s
been plenty of men over the years who told themselves it was their destiny to
save the world. And they always made the <strong>same</strong> mistake.</em><br>CLARK.
<em><strong>What</strong> mistake?</em><br>JONATHAN. <em>Thinking it was <strong>theirs</strong> to save.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/waid-kingdom-come-1996/>Kingdom Come (1996)</a>
has
heroes trying to save the world quick.</p></div></div><p>LOIS. <em>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I think you&rsquo;re <strong>great.</strong> But thousands of people
died of starvation and disease during the time it took me to say that I think
you&rsquo;re great. I fell that, in the end, the world doesn&rsquo;t need <strong>saving</strong> so much
as it needs <strong>changing.</strong> That if we&rsquo;re ever going to turn things <strong>around,</strong>
it&rsquo;s going to take more than just <strong>one guy</strong> in fireproof underwear.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><figure><img src=/img/fiction/causes-of-death-2019-full_1350.webp alt="Credits: https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death"><figcaption><p>Credits: <a href=https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death>https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Didn&rsquo;t realize that half of deaths are due to heart diseases and cancer, and

real wars are fought in polyester.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><p>BATMAN. <em>You might win a fight here. A battle there. But you&rsquo;ll never win if you
only play defense. And that&rsquo;s how <strong>they</strong> designed the game. With you always on
defense. You might win an election here&mldr; A lawsuit there&mldr; But that doesn&rsquo;t
bother them too much. Because they&rsquo;re playing by rules they make up as they go
along. Because you&rsquo;re never really allowed to score on them. So they know
they&rsquo;ll win in the end.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><p>SUPERMAN. <em>Using my laboratory at the fortress of solitude, I have discovered a
way to analyze the <strong>quantum DNA signature</strong> of every human being on earth. It&rsquo;s
like a precise snapshot of who you were at a specific moment in time, from which
we can extrapolate what your body <strong>will</strong> do. Meaning that if someone gives me
a sample of their DNA, I can cure every disease they have&mldr; or ever <strong>will
have.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Pretty cool having Superman achieve this. Took him two years, but that&rsquo;s still
superhuman, considering the amount of research that&rsquo;s been done so far about
diseases by so many scientists.</p></div></div><h2 id=hope>Hope</h2><p>LOIS. <em>But when you take the enormity of what this man meant to a nation, the
overwhelming grief we felt at his passing, the belief in the future he inspired
in us&mldr; And then subtract from that <strong>one ordinary life,</strong> whatever remains&mldr;
That is what we mean when we say <strong>hope</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>JOKER. <em>When you hope that your child died of smoke inhalation instead of
burning alive&mldr; Well let&rsquo;s just say it changes the way you define <strong>hope.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span></p><p>SUPERMAN. <em>I have made it my life&rsquo;s work to save these people. To save what I
could of the world that took me in. I have little hope that this plan will
succeed. But then, sometimes&mldr; hope is the lie we make come true.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This seems like the author&rsquo;s preferred definition. At the story&rsquo;s start, we know
that this earth won&rsquo;t survive, but we hope that somehow it will.</p></div></div><h2 id=existentialism>Existentialism</h2><p>SUPERMAN. <em>Existence was always so fragile. Every minute a miracle. How did we
not wake up every morning trembling in awe and wonder that we were here at all?
Jor-El sat on the ruling council of his world. And yet, he realized that life is
a negotiation with forces beyond your control. That in the end, you have to
accept fate on its <strong>own terms.</strong> Though occasionally, it does let you make a
<strong>counteroffer.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>BATMAN. <em>They call this the <strong>Space Age.</strong> A semi-optimistic confession that
they&rsquo;re looking for the exit. And yet, here we remain. Trapped in this place.
While the dreamers, politicians, and poets may have the luxury of looking to the
stars, someone needs to make a stand here on the ground. Among the dirt and
rats. In the gutters of their indifference.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>SUPERMAN. <em>The Space Age made us aware of how many threats lie beyond our
horizon. Of what a dangerous place this universe truly is. And yet, it all felt
so <strong>abstract.</strong> Like a fairy tale written by scientists and mathematicians.
Because, in the end, nobody ever quite believes in their own destruction. It&rsquo;s
so much more preferable to make up stories, to come up with heroes, to convince
ourselves that it&rsquo;s going to be all right. That we aren&rsquo;t <strong>really</strong> doomed.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><p>SUPERMAN. <em>Billions of little lights of consciousness flickering just long
enough to ask what it was they were supposed to illuminate before being snuffed
out <strong>forever.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span></p><h2 id=violence>Violence</h2><p>SOLDIER. <em>This will mean the destruction of <strong>everything,</strong> Sergei.</em><br>SERGEI. <em>No. The revolution will still be victorious. It just may take an extra
thousand years.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>LOIS. <em>It wasn&rsquo;t until afterward that my father learned that the real German
offensive had taken place <strong>forty miles</strong> to the south. They&rsquo;d fought that
battle over <strong>nothing.</strong> By chance, he later encountered the officer who&rsquo;d
commanded the Germans on the other side of the bridge. He asked the commandant
why he&rsquo;d sacrificed so many of his own men fighting for a bridge he <strong>knew</strong>
wasn&rsquo;t part of the German offensive. In broken English, the man replied, "
<strong>German</strong> offensive? We were told to guard bridge at all costs against an
<strong>American</strong> offensive."</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-01></a></span></p><p>BATMAN. <em>The correct answer, of course, is <strong>yes,</strong> you should flip the switch.
Even if an innocent person dies. Not to save the five lives&mldr; but to deny
whoever tied them to that track whatever it was that they <strong>wanted.</strong> To let
them know they <strong>failed.</strong> That they will <strong>always</strong> fail. Because in the long
run, <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> what saves lives. I suppose the purpose of the thought
experiment is to make you consider to what extent you&rsquo;re willing to play God.
But if you hold the power of <strong>life</strong> and <strong>death</strong> in your hands&mldr; then you&rsquo;re
not <strong>playing.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><p>SUPERMAN. <em>I&rsquo;d expected him to just start destroying the planet, extracting its
natural resources like he had other worlds. Instead, he first came to us as most
invaders do &ndash; as a missionary.</em><br>SUPERMAN. <em>So are you here to destroy the
earth or not?</em><br>BRAINIAC. <em>I <strong>am.</strong> That said, I&rsquo;m not the <strong>villain</strong> of
this tale.</em><br>WONDER WOMAN. <em>No one ever is.</em><br>BRAINIAC. <em>I am merely
salvaging what I can from this universe before it is destroyed by one <strong>far more
powerful</strong> than I.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-02></a></span></p><p>BATMAN. <em>Ruling by day as Bruce Wayne and by night as Batman, cleaning up Gotham
became easy. And when something becomes easy <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> when you have to worry.
Because success breeds imitators. And <strong>sloppiness.</strong> You put on a mask, take
over the streets, and soon <strong>everybody</strong> thinks they can do it. Not
understanding that you&rsquo;re a <strong>billionaire</strong> with access to <strong>cutting-edge
military technology</strong> and they&rsquo;re a <strong>pickup team</strong> who went shopping together
at <strong>costume city.</strong></em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span></p><h2 id=others-snapshots>Others' Snapshots</h2><p>Lex Luthor, instead of being a megalomaniac, is a sociopathic businessman taking
advantage of a system that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#GoodReadsSpaceAge></a></span></p><p>The story is confusingly structured with multiple pieces, e.g., the Justice
League being introduced but never being pivotal. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#PopCultReview></a></span></p><p>Batman makes bizarre life-defining decisions that are unlike him. Instead of <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SpaceAge-03></a></span>being mostly about Superman trying to save the world, we
get Mark Russell&rsquo;s patented social commentary about the evils of capitalism, the
pharmaceutical industry, the court system, and police corruption. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Hernandez2023></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class cited-by-count is-main><cite id=SpaceAge-01>Superman: Space Age: Book One<i>.</i></cite>
