prove that any two numbers are equal. No divisions by zero; no poorly defined
terms; no illegal operations; no independent axioms that are implicitly assumed;
her peers can&rsquo;t find fault in her proof.</p><p>Renee finds mathematics meaningless: the most elegant theorem wouldn&rsquo;t mean any
more than a nonsense equation. She is frustrated that the damned theorem made
sense. Recently had a nightmare about discovering a formalism that lets her
translate arbitrary concepts into mathematical expressions, and subsequently
prove that life and death are equivalent.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Chiang2010></a></span>was motivated by the beauty of \(e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0\).

enlightening.</p></div></div><p>Early 19th century: Mathematicians began exploring non-Euclidean geometries that
produced absurd results, yet without logical contradictions. Later shown that
these non-Euclidean geometries were logically consistent, as long as one assumed
that Euclidean geometry was consistent.</p><p>1900: David Hilbert lists his 23 most important unsolved problems of
mathematics. #2 was a request for a proof of the consistency of arithmetic, i.e.
one could never prove \(1 = 2\).</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Of the 23, 8 have solutions that have been accepted by consensus. 9 have
solutions that have been partially accepted. 4 are unresolved. 2 are deemed too
vague. One is deferred as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiHilbert23></a></span></p><p>In a similar vein, the Clay Institute listed 7 problems in 2000, each with a $1m
cash prize. \(P\ vs\ NP\) is probably the most popular one. Only 1 has
been solved. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiMilleniumPrize></a></span></p></div></div><p>1931: Kurt Gödel presents two theorems. First, mathematics contains statements
that may be true, but are inherently unprovable. Second, a claim of the
consistency of arithmetic is just such a statement.</p><p>1936: Gerhard Gentzen provided a proof of the consistency of arithmetic, but to
do it he needed to use a controversial technique known as transfinite induction.
What Gentzen had done was prove the obvious by assuming the doubtful.</p><h2 id=the-evolution-of-human-science>The Evolution of Human Science</h2><p>Metahumans increasingly use digital neural transfer to share findings. Journals
publish secondhand accounts translated into human language. Some insights are
inevitably lost in translation.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>A more relatable picture is how ML and AI practitioners are working on the
interpretability of the models. They seem motivated by the need to audit the
models for some definition of fairness. See
<a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/bias-and-fairness/>Computational Bias and
Fairness</a>
.</p></div></div><p>No way to augment a human brain into a metahuman one. Can only be done in the
very early stages, and parents would watch their child grow incomprehensible to
them. No parents opt into this.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Augmentation of human mental abilities seems like it&rsquo;d exacerbate inequality,
given that some humans would be able to commune with AI, while some wouldn&rsquo;t.
Granted, there is a rift between an educated and an illeterate person, but the
gulf between normal and AI-enhanced human would be vastly greater. Maybe we do
need those neuralinks to be available to all, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.
Going by the uneven COVID-19 vaccine distribution, I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p></div></div><p>Human researchers realize that they may never make an original contribution to
science again. Many quit, and the ones who stayed focus on hermeneutics, the
interpretation of the scientific work of metahumans.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>More extreme version of the

useful for humans, so what if we don&rsquo;t really understand these artefacts? But
hermeneutics still increases the body of human knowledge, just as original
research did. Furthermore, humans may discern applications overlooked by
metahumans.</p><h2 id=hell-is-the-absence-of-god>Hell Is the Absence of God</h2><p>Angel visitations are disruptive: storms, earthquakes, fires, etc. While there
are those healed, there are casualties too. Post-visitation, many became devout,
either out of gratitude or terror.</p><p>Hell also had manifestations. It was permanent exile from God. Its lost souls
went on with their lives, but couldn&rsquo;t apprehend the mortal plane. But everyone
knew that Heaven was incomparably superior.</p><p>Given God hadn&rsquo;t played a role in Neil&rsquo;s life, Neil wasn&rsquo;t afraid of being
exiled from God. However, after Sarah&rsquo;s death (shattered glass from Nathanael&rsquo;s
visitation) and ascension to Heaven, Neil now wanted to go to Heaven. For this,
he needed to earnestly love God. But one couldn&rsquo;t love God as a means to an end.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Short of forgetting about Sarah, I fail to see how Neil could love God earnestly
while on earth. It&rsquo;s not as if he can lie to God that he is no longer interested
in Sarah. Furthermore, the possibility of meeting Sarah in heaven is guaranteed,
so imagining that he&rsquo;d love God even without Sarah is a hypothetical that can
never be real.</p></div></div><p>For some couples, if one descended to hell, the other committed suicide
resulting in a happy reunion in hell. Neil shamefully wished Sarah were in hell,
for she could be happy in either place, but he could only be happy with her.</p><p>Sites of frequent visitations were holy sites. While some pilgrims went for
healing, others sought Heaven&rsquo;s light as those who&rsquo;d seen it went to Heaven
(most notably a serial rapist and murderer and rapist). Heaven&rsquo;s light was
observable on entry and exit of an angel. Entries were hard to predict, so
light-seekers converged on the angel and followed it till its departure.</p><p>Light-seeking was risky (e.g. staying in the funnel of a tornado). Far more
light-seekers died in the attempts than succeeded, and all who&rsquo;d failed were now
in hell. Neil found light-seeking&rsquo;s all-or-nothing quality frightening and
attractive. Trying to love God was maddening, and likely to fail. Furthermore,
what if he died soon?</p><p>In Barakiel&rsquo;s visitation, Neil crashed in his light-seeking attempt, and was
slowly but surely bleeding to death. He knew no heavenly bargain was possible.
He prayed for Sarah&rsquo;s forgiveness of his reckless gamble. However, Heaven&rsquo;s
light struck trapped Neil, imbuing him with an ineffable love for God. God sent
Neil to hell anyway.</p><p>Ethan, whose life mission was to find out his divine purpose, saw it all. He
started preaching that people can no more expect justice in the afterlife than
in the mortal plane. If they wish to love God, they be prepared to do so despite
the lack of justice, kindness and mercy. Now that is true devotion.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>An amoral God is a terrifying thought. Also explored in The Sandman, where
<a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/fiction/neil-gaiman-sandman/#evil>souls go to hell if they have any guilt</a>
.</p><p>Reminds me of the just-world hypothesis (a cognitive bias that assumes that
people get what they deserve), but much of the Wikipedia discussion is on
victim-blaming. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiJustWorld></a></span></p><p>Maybe closer to the concept of karma, where like deeds lead to like effects, either in one&rsquo;s current life, or in future lives. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WikiKarma></a></span></p><p>One argument goes: if God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and
morally perfect; however, that evil exists suggests that God doesn&rsquo;t exist
because the 3 non-negotiable qualities cannot co-exist with evil. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#SEPProblemOfEvil></a></span></p></div></div><p>In hell, Neil still loves Sarah. He knows that there was no reason nor divine
purpose for him being in hell, but he loves God anyway, even when God is not
aware of his love.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>This would make a great movie. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Chiang2010></a></span>was dismayed by the happy

digital &ldquo;Data Earth&rdquo; world. They are not instantiated intelligent, but they can
be taught, and in the course of interacting with the world, develop traits.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Zuckerberg hopes to build the &ldquo;metaverse&rdquo;, a persistent synchronous environment
(VR, AR) where people can interact more naturally (as opposed to just being on
screens). <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Newton2021></a></span></p></div></div><p>Human preferences are put above digients'. For example, being reset to a
previously &ldquo;good&rdquo; checkpoint when they exhibit undesirable behavior, e.g.
cussing, irritability, etc.. Jax, a digient, fears being suspended (rendered
inactive) because he&rsquo;ll miss real time.</p><p>Digients can interact with the real world via robot bodies. They are fascinated
the rich detail in the real world, e.g. human anatomy, texture in surfaces,
etc.. Humans feel god-like, e.g. being able to suspend digients, writing code
that affects the digients' digital worlds. Some digients want to be registered
as corporations so that they can have more agency and participate in activities
such as earning wages.</p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The setting reminds me of HBO&rsquo;s Westworld&rsquo;s android &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; who: learn from
their experiences with humans, are created for commercial gain, have their
memories reset periodically, are frequently treated as toys for the humans, and
desire self-determinism. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#wikiWestworld></a></span></p></div></div><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Humans' god-like stature to digients evokes curiosity on whether we, humans, are
some entity&rsquo;s equivalent of digients? What would it feel like to step out of our
world and into <em>their</em> world? What motivation would <em>they</em> have for
instantiating us?</p><p>Most of the Sci-Fi I&rsquo;ve encountered posit <em>their</em> motivation is commercial
profit. Andy Weir&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Egg&rdquo; suggests a different answer: the universe is an
egg, and only you exist; once you live every human life, you&rsquo;ll be ready to be
born as one of <em>them</em>. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Weir2009></a></span></p></div></div><p>Binary Desire (a company) proposes to finance the porting of digients from the
now-obsolete &ldquo;Data Earth&rdquo; (Blue Gamma went out of business) world to the &ldquo;Real
Space&rdquo; world. In exchange, the digient(s) are available to be made into a
consensual (via rewiring the digient&rsquo;s reward map) sex partner product. Marco
and Polo (Derek&rsquo;s digients) are willing to accept Binary Desire&rsquo;s proposition.
Another option for financing is having Ana work at Polytope, which requires
neuro-chemical implants. Derek chooses to grant his digients' wish, but his main
motivation is so that Ana (a human) doesn&rsquo;t undergo neuro-chemical manipulation.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=WikiBabel>Tower of Babel<i>.</i></cite>
