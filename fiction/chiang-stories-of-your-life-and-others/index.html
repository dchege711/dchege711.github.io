Babel <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiBabel"></a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Chiang2010"></a></span> notes that the Hebrew school version was more elaborate
than the Old Testament account, e.g. the tower is so tall that it takes a year
to climb, and when a man falls to his death, no one mourns, but when a brick is
dropped, the brick-layers weep because it will take a year to replace.</p>
<p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiBabel"></a></span> lists other variations. In the Greco-Roman one, the
giants stacked mountains to reach (and conquer) the gods in heaven, but Jupiter
repelled them with his thunderbolts. In the Cherokee one, the humans tried
building a lofty structure to escape the flood-prone earth, but the gods halved
the height twice, and in the 2nd blow, the tribe&rsquo;s language was
confused/destroyed that there was no 3rd effort.</p>
<p><span class="citation-ref"><a href="#Asimov1971"></a></span> posits that the Tower of Babel was an ambitious ziggurat
began by a Sumerian king, but left unfinished due to war in the south.
Nebuchadnezzar finished the ziggurat in 600 B.C.</p>

<p>Leon sets out to design a new gestalt-oriented language for his mind. He
understands precisely how he knows. The new language can describe and modify its
own operations. He is meta-aware of his consciousness, and can meta-program
himself.</p>

sort of intervention is required. Perhaps I would see the soul, the ingredient
of consciousness that surpasses physicality. Proof of God?</p>
<p>Reynold, another more advanced superintelligent human, asserts that as long as
they can comprehend the affairs of normals, then they can&rsquo;t ignore the normals.
Leon, however, views intelligence as an end in itself.</p>

<h2 id="division-by-zero">Division by Zero</h2>
<p>Renee, a mathematician, is working on a formalism, that ends up being able to
prove that any two numbers are equal. No divisions by zero; no poorly defined
terms; no illegal operations; no independent axioms that are implicitly assumed;
her peers can&rsquo;t find fault in her proof.</p>
<p>Renee finds mathematics meaningless: the most elegant theorem wouldn&rsquo;t mean any
more than a nonsense equation. She is frustrated that the damned theorem made
sense. Recently had a nightmare about discovering a formalism that lets her
translate arbitrary concepts into mathematical expressions, and subsequently
prove that life and death are equivalent.</p>

    <div class="comment"><p>While the story itself is captivating, the sprinkles of math history are
enlightening.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Early 19th century: Mathematicians began exploring non-Euclidean geometries that
produced absurd results, yet without logical contradictions. Later shown that
these non-Euclidean geometries were logically consistent, as long as one assumed
that Euclidean geometry was consistent.</p>
<p>1900: David Hilbert lists his 23 most important unsolved problems of
mathematics. #2 was a request for a proof of the consistency of arithmetic, i.e.
one could never prove \(1 = 2\).</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Of the 23, 8 have solutions that have been accepted by consensus. 9 have
solutions that have been partially accepted. 4 are unresolved. 2 are deemed too
vague. One is deferred as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiHilbert23"></a></span></p>
<p>In a similar vein, the Clay Institute listed 7 problems in 2000, each with a $1m
cash prize. \(P\ vs\ NP\) is probably the most popular one. Only 1 has
been solved. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiMilleniumPrize"></a></span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>1931: Kurt Gödel presents two theorems. First, mathematics contains statements
that may be true, but are inherently unprovable. Second, a claim of the
consistency of arithmetic is just such a statement.</p>
<p>1936: Gerhard Gentzen provided a proof of the consistency of arithmetic, but to
do it he needed to use a controversial technique known as transfinite induction.
What Gentzen had done was prove the obvious by assuming the doubtful.</p>

<p>No way to augment a human brain into a metahuman one. Can only be done in the

<p>Human researchers realize that they may never make an original contribution to
science again. Many quit, and the ones who stayed focus on hermeneutics, the
interpretation of the scientific work of metahumans.</p>

<p>Some question the worthwhileness of hermeneutics. The metahumans create things
useful for humans, so what if we don&rsquo;t really understand these artefacts? But
hermeneutics still increases the body of human knowledge, just as original
research did. Furthermore, humans may discern applications overlooked by
metahumans.</p>
<h2 id="hell-is-the-absence-of-god">Hell Is the Absence of God</h2>
<p>Angel visitations are disruptive: storms, earthquakes, fires, etc. While there
are those healed, there are casualties too. Post-visitation, many became devout,
either out of gratitude or terror.</p>
<p>Hell also had manifestations. It was permanent exile from God. Its lost souls
went on with their lives, but couldn&rsquo;t apprehend the mortal plane. But everyone
knew that Heaven was incomparably superior.</p>
<p>Given God hadn&rsquo;t played a role in Neil&rsquo;s life, Neil wasn&rsquo;t afraid of being
exiled from God. However, after Sarah&rsquo;s death (shattered glass from Nathanael&rsquo;s
visitation) and ascension to Heaven, Neil now wanted to go to Heaven. For this,
he needed to earnestly love God. But one couldn&rsquo;t love God as a means to an end.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Short of forgetting about Sarah, I fail to see how Neil could love God earnestly
while on earth. It&rsquo;s not as if he can lie to God that he is no longer interested
in Sarah. Furthermore, the possibility of meeting Sarah in heaven is guaranteed,
so imagining that he&rsquo;d love God even without Sarah is a hypothetical that can
never be real.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>For some couples, if one descended to hell, the other committed suicide
resulting in a happy reunion in hell. Neil shamefully wished Sarah were in hell,
for she could be happy in either place, but he could only be happy with her.</p>
<p>Sites of frequent visitations were holy sites. While some pilgrims went for
healing, others sought Heaven&rsquo;s light as those who&rsquo;d seen it went to Heaven
(most notably a serial rapist and murderer and rapist). Heaven&rsquo;s light was
observable on entry and exit of an angel. Entries were hard to predict, so
light-seekers converged on the angel and followed it till its departure.</p>
<p>Light-seeking was risky (e.g. staying in the funnel of a tornado). Far more
light-seekers died in the attempts than succeeded, and all who&rsquo;d failed were now
in hell. Neil found light-seeking&rsquo;s all-or-nothing quality frightening and
attractive. Trying to love God was maddening, and likely to fail. Furthermore,
what if he died soon?</p>
<p>In Barakiel&rsquo;s visitation, Neil crashed in his light-seeking attempt, and was
slowly but surely bleeding to death. He knew no heavenly bargain was possible.
He prayed for Sarah&rsquo;s forgiveness of his reckless gamble. However, Heaven&rsquo;s
light struck trapped Neil, imbuing him with an ineffable love for God. God sent
Neil to hell anyway.</p>
<p>Ethan, whose life mission was to find out his divine purpose, saw it all. He
started preaching that people can no more expect justice in the afterlife than
in the mortal plane. If they wish to love God, they be prepared to do so despite
the lack of justice, kindness and mercy. Now that is true devotion.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the just-world hypothesis (a cognitive bias that assumes that
people get what they deserve), but much of the Wikipedia discussion is on
victim-blaming. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiJustWorld"></a></span></p>
<p>Maybe closer to the concept of karma, where like deeds lead to like effects, either in one&rsquo;s current life, or in future lives. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#WikiKarma"></a></span></p>
<p>One argument goes: if God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and
morally perfect; however, that evil exists suggests that God doesn&rsquo;t exist
because the 3 non-negotiable qualities cannot co-exist with evil. <span class="citation-ref"><a href="#SEPProblemOfEvil"></a></span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>In hell, Neil still loves Sarah. He knows that there was no reason nor divine
purpose for him being in hell, but he loves God anyway, even when God is not
aware of his love.</p>
