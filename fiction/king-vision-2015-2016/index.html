traffic on 66 or Lee highway. On the weekends they tended to stay in Virginia,
though they often lamented that they should go into the city. The museums are so
nice, and the kids would have a great time. Very few of them were from the area
originally. Most had moved to D.C. after college and worked for congress or the
president. They made nothing, and they lived off of nothing. But that was
unimportant. They were young, and they wanted to save the world. Eventually,
they met someone and fell in love and had children. With bills to pay, they left
their small government jobs; they became lobbyists and lawyers and managers.
They moved out to the suburbs for the schools. They made the compromises that
are necessary to raise a family.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Chilling characterization of how ideals die in the name of family. Yet, <em>this</em>
is what Vision wants, a normal run-of-the-mill family life.</p></div></div><p>[Vision] <em>You misunderstand. It is the ironic aspect of &ldquo;nice&rdquo; that gives the
statement its meaning. As &ldquo;kind&rdquo; is unironic, to &ldquo;seem kind&rdquo; is to imply the
potential of not being kind, or of being cruel. In contrast, &ldquo;nice,&rdquo; due to its
ironic interpretation, has a more flexible connotation. As such, &ldquo;they seem
nice&rdquo; has a proper meaning of they may be nice or they may not be nice.</em>
[Virginia] <em>Then the phrase is meaningless.</em> [Vision] <em>Obviously. To assert as
truth that which has no meaning is the core mission of humanity.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-01></a></span></p><p><em>Vision had explained to them that they obviously could memorize the words and
figures in any book provided. However, Vision rightly noted that the ability to
combine these figures into rhetoric, into creative endeavors, this had to be
learned. Facts without context are like individuals without society. Just as an
individual must find his or her place in society or else they are useless, a
fact must find its place in an argument or else it serves no true purpose.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-01></a></span></p><p><em>Though he did not tell The President, he hoped The White House would offer him
an official position, where he might draw a salary. The Avengers were no longer
offering wages, and he was uncertain how long his savings would last.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Falcon in <span class=citation-ref><a href=#FalconAndWS2021></a></span>also faced financial hardships. The
thread shared with Vision is that they&rsquo;re both in minority groups. One would
expect that an Avenger should live comfortably &ndash; after all, they&rsquo;ve saved the
planet from annihilation multiple times!</p></div></div><p>[Vision] <em>Let us then just say that my son will take the <strong>standard</strong> suspension
of a child involved in a conflagration of this sort. Further discipline will be
handled by <strong>myself</strong> and his <strong>mother.</strong></em> [Principal Waxman] <em>That&rsquo;s not your
decision to make.</em> [Vision] <em>I am <strong>The Vision of The Avengers.</strong> I have saved
this planet <strong>thirty-seven</strong> times. Each day you <strong>live.</strong> Each breath you
<strong>take.</strong> Each beat of your <strong>heart.</strong> <strong>Each</strong> is due to my actions.
Thirty-seven times over. You are <strong>quite</strong> correct, it is not my decision to
make. It is merely my <strong>considered</strong> opinion that this is the proper course of
action. But I do believe you will recognize that fighting me in this matter will
not in the end prove to be beneficial.</em> [Narrator] <em>Principal Sam Waxman of
Alexander Hamilton High School will remember this moment for the rest of his
life. He will <strong>wonder</strong> what would have happened if he had been firmer with
<strong>The Visions</strong> that day, if he had not retreated from his initial position.
Would that have made a difference? If he had acted <strong>right then,</strong> right at the
beginning &ndash; <strong>maybe</strong> he too could&rsquo;ve saved the world.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Vision&rsquo;s cracks started to show in this scene. The Narrator&rsquo;s description of
Principal Waxman&rsquo;s thoughts is an apt foreshadowing tool. What will Vision do?</p></div></div><p>[Viv] <em>This is the seventh time I am preparing this game, Vin. The ball has not
moved. You have not kicked it. You have not <strong>earned</strong> my trust.</em> [Vin] <em>That is
not trust. That is prediction. Anyone can predict the future based on past
events. This is mere pattern recognition. The lowest form of cognition. Trust is
the ability to believe without evidence. It is an act of <strong>faith.</strong> The
<strong>highest</strong> form of cognition. Understanding and embracing faith moves us closer
to humanity.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-04></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p><a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/knowing/hofstadter-geb/#strange-loops>Strange loop</a>
in the
cognition hierarchy presented here. Believing without evidence seems like the
lowest form of cognition too, as it can be done without mental effort. Or can
it? One needs to convince themselves why faith is reasonable&mldr; Hmm&mldr;</p></div></div><p>[Vin] <em>That was entirely unfair! The ball was thrown by father for me!</em> [Viv]
<em>Now brother, fairness is a simple mathematically determined balance, the lowest
form of justice. <strong>Preeminence,</strong> however, is the assertion of complex covenants
over instinctual norms. The <strong>highest</strong> form of justice. Understanding and
embracing preeminence moves us closer to humanity.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-04></a></span></p><p>[Vision] <em>I would lose the trust of The Avengers. And without this trust, I
could not adequately support you in the days ahead. We would be subjected to the
whims of all the people who see us only as wires and electrodes. The people who
do not understand what we are attempting to accomplish. Or rather, those who do
not understand that we are not attempting to accomplish <strong>anything.</strong> We are
just&mldr; We just <strong>are.</strong></em> [Narrator] <em>Vision thought he could make a family. A
happy, normal family. It was merely a matter of calculation. The right formula,
shortcut, algorithm. <strong>P.</strong> What a shock to see the dog in the yard and the body
in the dirt. To discover that it was all beyond him. All his efforts would
likely never produce the answer he knew was there. <strong>NP.</strong></em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-06></a></span></p><p>[Agatha Harkness] <em>And so The Vision has abandoned the illusion of P in favor of
the reality of NP. He will now do anything, everything, in his attempt to find
happiness for his wife and children. He will kill you. He will kill <strong>your</strong>
families. He will raze the world.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-06></a></span></p><p>[Wanda] <em>You&rsquo;re a damn <strong>toaster!</strong></em> [Vision] <em>Wanda&mldr;</em> [Wanda] <em><strong>They&rsquo;re</strong>
not real? What are <strong>you?!</strong></em> [Vision] <em>I want a family. I want it as much as
you do.</em> [Wanda] <em><strong>Who</strong> are you?! Huh? <strong>What</strong> are you?! To tell me they&rsquo;re
not real!</em> [Vision] <em>But this is not a family. This is a lie. And what good can
come out of this lie?</em> [Wanda] <em><strong>You&rsquo;re not real!</strong></em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-07></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Wanda&rsquo;s desire to have a family is also explored in live action: <span class=citation-ref><a href=#MultiverseOfMadness2022></a></span>and <span class=citation-ref><a href=#WandaVision2021></a></span>. In TV and film,
Wanda&rsquo;s desire for motherhood also brings harm, and sometimes death, to other
people. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol1></a></span>is tamer by comparison.</p></div></div><p>[Wanda] <em>Simon &ndash; He makes happy. I love him. I want you&mldr; After everything, I
want you to be happy. You&rsquo;re based on Simon. You have his brain patterns. Maybe
that&rsquo;s why &ndash; Why Simon and I work, because he&rsquo;s like you, but he&rsquo;s not you.
These are <strong>my</strong> brain patterns, so you can &ndash; maybe you can make&mldr; Maybe you
can <strong>find</strong> someone who&rsquo;s like me, but who&rsquo;s not me.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-07></a></span></p><p>[Virginia] <em>I told this to Vision. But I don&rsquo;t think he understood. Or maybe he
did not not want to hear. When when I simply access the notes and play play play
them well&mldr; I seem to feel that I am not playing them. I have&mldr; Simply&mldr;
Become the piano. I am perfect perfect perfect. I am the piano.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-08></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Is perfection anti-human? Maybe. If I&rsquo;m watching an NBA game, and Curry is
hitting all shots, then that&rsquo;s not as fun anymore. But it&rsquo;s also not fun if he&rsquo;s
missing some shots. Maybe nigh-perfect is the sweet spot. Not so perfect that
there is no variability, and not so imperfect that it&rsquo;s average.</p></div></div><p>[Viv] <em>I do not know if there is a God. It seems unlikely.</em> [Vision] <em>Yes. It
does seem unlikely.</em> [Viv] <em>I also do not know if Vin had a soul. This, too,
seems unlikely.</em> [Vision] <em>Yes.</em> [Viv] <em>So first, I pray that there is a God.
Then I pray that Vin had a soul. Then I pray for God to allow Vin&rsquo;s soul to
rest. If that order is satisfactory, father, then perhaps you will follow me?</em>
[Vision] <em>Yes, Viv. That will be fine.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-10></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Memorable on first encounter, but if we&rsquo;re being pedantic, doesn&rsquo;t praying
presume that God exists?</p></div></div><p>[Vin] <em>&ldquo;How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony&rsquo;s nephew? Very vilely
in the morning, when he is sober. And most vilely in the afternoon, when he is
drunk. When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he
little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
make shift to go without him."</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-10></a></span></p><p><em>When Ultron had finished, Vision said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me only what powers I
possess &ndash; not what I wish to know! Who am I? What name is mine?&rdquo; &ldquo;No name,
clown!&rdquo; Ultron said. &ldquo;What need has an inhuman slave of a name&mldr; Even a number?
I gave you a mind so that you could obey me&mldr; Not dispute me!&rdquo; The synthezoid
objected. &ldquo;Then, the mind is of no use if it cannot question!&rdquo; &ldquo;Think what you
like, Android,&rdquo; Ultron said. &ldquo;But you shall perform the mission for which you
were created. You must kill the Avengers."</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-11></a></span></p><p><em>The first words the synthezoid ever heard were the words of her husband. I am
The Vision of The Avengers. I have saved the world thirty-seven times. I am here
to welcome you to life.&rdquo; Vision told the synthezoid her name. &ldquo;You are
Virginia.&rdquo; He explained to her that she was a good person. That she was made to
be a good person with a free will of her own. Now, should she so desire, she
could join him on his quest to live a good life. They could marry. They could
have a house. They could have children. They could be part of a happy, normal
family.</em> <span class=citation-ref><a href=#VisionVol2-11></a></span></p><p>[Viv] <em>But Wanda, I do not understand. Parents sacrifice their lives for their
children. Then children become parents and sacrifice their own lives. And so all
is sacrificed and nothing is gained. Life then becomes the pursuit of an
unobtainable purpose by absurd means.</em> [Wanda] <em>What is it Portia says in The
Merchant of Venice? Vin would know. &ldquo;One half of me is yours, the other half
yours &ndash; Mine own, I would say. But if mine, then yours &ndash; and so all yours."</em>

them all the same.</p></div></div><p><span class=citation-ref><a href=#PopCult2016></a></span><em>The Vision is the story of immigrants in a strange
