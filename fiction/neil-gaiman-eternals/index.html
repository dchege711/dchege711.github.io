<p>Mark Evanier: Can you prove that ancient civilizations weren&rsquo;t visited by space
travellers and heralded as gods? Did those aliens alight on this planet eons ago
and plant the seeds of our civilization?</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>The lack of concrete answers for these questions makes Eternals a worthwhile
hypothetical. Prometheus addresses a similar question with the concept of
Engineers.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Jack Kirby, 1976: I feel that playing around with this sort of conjecture is
highly entertaining, and that we should aim our gunsights at this giant puzzle
we&rsquo;ve inherited more often. We can&rsquo;t leave it all to the professors, pundits and
paperback prophets. The puzzle belongs to you and me as well.</p>
<p><em>Chariot of the Gods?</em> proposed that aliens had visited Earth in the distant
past, influencing ancient cultures, including the Mayans. It was a best seller
in the 70s, much to the dismay of academics.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>I don&rsquo;t like the idea that humans did not figure out our advancements by
ourselves. The premise of Eternals providing key advancements like agriculture,
metallurgy, fire, writing feels underwhelming.</p>
<p>As much as I&rsquo;m not a fan of Great Man™ theories, it&rsquo;d be a bummer if humanity
needed outside hints to progress.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Premise: Celestials came to Earth and examined and split a proto-human, and from
it, produced two templates: one for the Eternals and one for the Deviants.</p>
<p>Eternals are guiders/protectors. As long as Earth is, the Eternals cannot die.
The Eternals, being disease-free, immortal and superpowered, are programmed to
believe their family relationships, given artificial memories, programmed and
not to question things.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Supernatural beings that are in service of the physiologically inferior humans,
at the behest of superior beings mirrors the angels, humans and God dynamic in
Christianity.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Deviants are different from the Eternals in that each member is a roll of the
genetic dice, as opposed to being the pinnacle of evolution. The Deviants
(Changing People) were created by the Golden One, a Celestial. He wanted to let
the Deviants be for he had given them dominion over the Earth. However, the
other Celestials tricked him, buried the Golden One (The Dreaming Celestial),
and scattered the Changing People.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Why make the Deviants if all they&rsquo;ll cause is harm? A similar question arises
for why create The Devil.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Bad guys shooting at party guests. Makkari enters hyperspeed for the first time.
Deliberates that moving the people at hyperspeed will kill/injure them. Picking
up the bulltets is infeasible because they&rsquo;re too hot and the energy has to go
somewhere. Picks up bullets in a metallic bucket and puts them in a safe. Talks
of things ahead of him blue-shifting and behind him red-shifting.</p>

. Not sure how Makkari was
able to open the safe though.</p>

</div>


<p>The Dreaming Celestial: When I spoke, worlds listened, and when I was silent,
the solar winds did not blow for fear they might disturb my thoughts.</p>



<div class="comment-holder">
    <div class="comment"><p>Vivid personification. I like it!</p>

</div>


<p>Dreaming Celestial: They said it [The Changing People?] was a crime against
life, but without me there could have been no life.</p>

doesn&rsquo;t hold on lower scales</p>
