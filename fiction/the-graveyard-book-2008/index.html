This man&rsquo;s clothes were darker. People who noticed the man Jack when he was
about his business found themselves troubled. The man Jack looked up at the
stranger, and it was the man Jack who was troubled.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>The parallelism is effective and simple. Exalts Silas when compared to the man
Jack who just massacred a family. The simplicity of the language makes the
narrator feel more truthful.</p></div></div><p><em>Then, in a voice like the chiming of a hundred tiny silver bells, she said
only&mldr;</em><br>WOMAN. <em>The dead should have charity.</em><br><em>And she smiled.
That, at least, was what the folk of the graveyard who had been on the hillside
that night claimed what happened. The debate was over and ended, and without so
much as a show of hands, had been decided. The child called Nobody Owens would
be given the freedom of the graveyard.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-01></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Who is this woman on the horse? My money is on her being Death. Still, memorable
intro!</p></div></div><p><em>That Scarlett could not see some of Bod&rsquo;s other friends did not seem to matter.
She had already been told by her parents that Bod was imaginary. And that there
was nothing wrong with that. So it was no surprise to her that Bod also had
imaginary friends.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-02></a></span></p><p>BOD. <em>What&rsquo;s particle physics?</em><br>SCARLETT. <em>Well, there&rsquo;s atoms, which is
things too small to see&mldr; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re made of. And there&rsquo;s things that&rsquo;s
smaller than atoms. And that&rsquo;s particle physics.</em><br><em>Bod nodded and
decided that Scarlett&rsquo;s father was probably interested in imaginary things.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-02></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Bod&rsquo;s and Scarlett&rsquo;s internal reasoning is logical, but we as the readers see
the fault. Sort of endearing and emphasizes their naïveté.</p></div></div><p><em>And then the Indigo Man threw back his head and let out a series of yodeling
screams that made Scarlett grip Bod&rsquo;s hand so tightly that her fingernails
pressed into his flesh. Bod was no longer scared though.</em><br>SCARLETT. <em>I&rsquo;m
sorry I said they were imaginary. I believe now. They&rsquo;re real.</em><br>INDIGO
MAN. <em>ALL WHO INVADE THIS PLACE WILL DIE!</em><br>BOD. <em>No, I think you&rsquo;re right.
This one is.</em><br>SCARLETT. <em>Is what?</em><br>BOD. <em>Imaginary.</em><br>SCARLETT. <em>Don&rsquo;t be stupid. I can see it.</em><br>BOD. <em>Yes, and you
can&rsquo;t see dead people.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-02></a></span></p><p>MR. PENNYWORTH. <em>You are difficult to miss. If you came to me in company
with a purple lion, a green elephant, and a scarlet unicorn astride which was
the king of England in his royal robes, I do believe that it is you and you
alone that people would stare at, dismissing the others as minor
irrelevancies!</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-04></a></span></p><p><em>Bod shivered. He wanted to embrace his guardian, tell him that he would never
desert him, but the action was unthinkable. There were people you could hug&mldr;
and then there was Silas.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-05></a></span></p><p><em>No one noticed the boy, not at first. No one even noticed that they hadn&rsquo;t
noticed him.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-06></a></span></p><p><em>Nick had little imagination. Mo had an imagination, and the hairs on the back
of her neck her prickling.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-06></a></span></p><p><em>Bod could feel the graveyard itself trying to hide him, to protect him, to make
him vanish, and he fought it, worked to be seen.</em><br>TROT. <em>Hola, young Bod!
I hear that excitement is the master of the hour, that you fling yourself
through these dominions like a comet across the firmament.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-07></a></span></p><p><em>What Scarlett saw was not what Bod saw. She did not see the sleer, and that was
a mercy. She saw the man Jack, though. He was floating in the air, five, then
ten feet above the ground, slashing wildly at the air with two knives, trying to
stab something she could not see, in a display that was obviously having no
effect.</em><br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-07></a></span></p><p>SILAS. But you will undoubtedly be happier if you remember none of this. So let
us walk together, you and I, and discuss what has happened to you over the last
few days, and what it might be wise for you to remember, and what it might be
better for you to forget.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#GraveyardBook-07></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class cited-by-count is-main><cite id=GraveyardBook-01>The Graveyard Book #01<i>.</i>
