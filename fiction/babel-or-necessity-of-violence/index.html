begin, grow, and flourish. And later, together, they fall. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>&ldquo;Translate, please.&rdquo; This all hinged on him, Robin realized. The choice was his.
Only he could determine the truth, because only he could communicate it to all
parties. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Every language is complex in its own way. Latin just happens to work its
complexity into the shape of the word. Its morphological richness is an asset,
not an obstacle. Consider the sentence <em>He will learn</em>. <em>Tā huì
xué</em>. Three words in both English and Chinese. In Latin, it takes only one.
<em>Disce</em>. Much more elegant, you see? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He read the city, and he learned its language. New words in English were a game
to him, for in understanding the word he always came to understand something
about English history or culture itself. [&mldr;] <em>Goodbye</em> was, incredibly,
a shortened version of <em>God be with you</em>. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>The power of the bar lies in words. More specifically, the stuff of language
that words are incapable of expressing &ndash; the stuff that gets lost when we move
between one language and another. The silver catches what&rsquo;s lost and manifests
it into being. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>An interesting side project can be to generate silver bars programmatically
using word embeddings.</p></div></div><p>One particularly ingenious pair was the translation from the Chinese character
<em>gǔ</em> meaning &lsquo;old or aged&rsquo;, and the English &lsquo;old&rsquo;. [&mldr;] Linking the
concepts of durability and antiquity helped prevent machinery from decaying over
time; in fact, the longer it was in use, the more reliable it became. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>So you see, translators do not so much deliver a message as they rewrite the
original. And herein lies the difficulty &ndash; rewriting is still writing, and
writing always reflects the author&rsquo;s ideology and biases. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>It is often argued that the greatest tragedy of the Old Testament was not man&rsquo;s
exile from the Garden of Eden, but the fall of the Tower of Babel. For Adam and
Eve, though cast from grace, could still speak and comprehend the language of
angels. [&mldr;] What was lost at Babel was not merely human unity, but the
original language &ndash; something primordial and innate, perfectly understandable
and lacking nothing in form or content. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span><span class=tag-ref><a href=/tags/gestalt>#gestalt</a></span></p><p><em>The language of translation ought, we think, as far as possible, to be a
pure, impalpable, and invisible element, the medium of thought and feeling, and
nothing more.</em> But what do we know of thought and feeling except as
expressed through language? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>It felt good to sink into the refuge of a dead language, to fight a rhetorical
war whose stakes could not really touch him. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>So the translator needs to be translator, literary critic, and poet all at once
&ndash; he must read the original well enough to understand all the machinery at
play, to convey its meaning with as much accuracy as possible, then rearrange
the translated meaning into an aesthetically pleasing structure in the target
language that, by his judgment, matches the original. The poet runs untrammelled
across the meadow. The translator dances in shackles. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Do we try our hardest, as translators, to render ourselves invisible? Or do we
remind the reader that what they are reading was not written in their native
language? [&mldr;] But what is the opposite of fidelity? Betrayal. Translation
means doing violence upon the original, means warping and distorting it for
foreign, unintended eyes. [&mldr;] How can we conclude, except by acknowledging
that an act of translation is then necessarily always an act of betrayal? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><h2 id=change>Change</h2><p>Now, what <em>I</em> wish is that all these women would stop taking part in
those anti-slavery debates. They see too much of themselves in their situation;
it puts ideas in their head. [&mldr;] She&rsquo;d like to think that it&rsquo;s a hop and a
skip from abolition to women&rsquo;s suffrage. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Translation, from time immemorial, has been the facilitator of peace.
Translation makes possible communication, which in turn makes possible the kind
of diplomacy, trade, and cooperation between foreign peoples that bring wealth
and prosperity to all. You&rsquo;ve noticed by now, surely, that Babel alone among the
Oxford faculties accepts students not of European origin. Nowhere else in this
country will you find Hindus, Muslims, Africans, and Chinamen studying under the
same roof. We accept you not despite, but <em>because</em> of your foreign
backgrounds. Because of your origins, you have the gift of languages those born
in England cannot imitate. And you, like Psammetichus&rsquo;s boys, are the tongues
that will speak this vision of global harmony into being. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Provides a story of why Babel is trying to change Oxford&rsquo;s status quo. However,
the devil is in the details of how the global harmony is spoken into existence.</p><p>A common framework for this phenomenon is &ldquo;espoused values&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;enacted
values&rdquo;. The former refers to publicly declared values/goals that an
individual/organization claims to hold, e.g., a company&rsquo;s website saying, &ldquo;Our
people are our greatest asset&rdquo;. The latter refers to values that are actually
exhibited though consistent actions and behaviors, e.g., the same company
invests heavily in technology but cuts employee training budgets. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#EspousedVsEnacted></a></span></p></div></div><p>&ldquo;The point of it all is to keep amassing silver. We possess all this silver
because we cajole, manipulate, and threaten other countries into trade deals
that keep the cash flowing homeward. And we enforce those trade deals with the
same silver bars, now inscribed with Babel&rsquo;s work, that make our ships faster,
our soldiers hardier, and our guns more deadly. It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle of profit,
and unless some outside force breaks the cycle, sooner or later Britain will
possess all the wealth in the world. We are that outside force. Hermes. We
funnel away silver to people, communities, and movements that deserve it. We aid
slave revolts. Resistance movements. We melt down silver bars made for cleaning
doilies and use them to cure disease instead. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> what this is all
for.&rdquo; This was, Robin had to admit, a very compelling theory of the world. Only
it seemed to implicate nearly everything he held dear. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>PROFESSOR CRAFT. Babel hardly discriminates against women. It&rsquo;s simply that so
few of our sex are interested in languages.<br>LETTY. But you&rsquo;re the only
woman professor at Babel, and we all &ndash; that is, all the girls here and I &ndash; we
think that&rsquo;s quite admirable, so I wanted &ndash;<br>PROFESSOR CRAFT. To know how
it&rsquo;s done? Hard work and innate brilliance. You know that already.<br>LETTY.
It&rsquo;s different for women, though, and surely you&rsquo;ve experienced &ndash;<br>PROFESSOR CRAFT. When I have relevant topics for discussion, I will bring them
up in class, Miss Price. But class is over. And you&rsquo;re now infringing on my
time.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>See
<a href=https://www.curiosities.dev/computer-science/2021-10-28-socio-economic-equity-in-tech/>Socio-Economic Equity in Tech</a>
for a
treatment on the same, but in the tech industry.</p></div></div><p>But language is not like a commercial good, like tea or silks, to be bought and
paid for. Language is an infinite resource. And if we learn it, if we use it &ndash;
who are we stealing from? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Digital goods, e.g., songs, play at this categorization in the real world.
Producing a song takes labor, but once you have a copy of the song in your
phone, then it&rsquo;s an infinite resource? However, the music industry has coalesced
into leasing songs, e.g., through a Spotify subscription. Granted running a
service like Spotify needs $$$, but at some point, haven&rsquo;t I paid enough to
&ldquo;own&rdquo; &ldquo;own&rdquo; the copy of the song?</p></div></div><p>He could not bear how this confession would shatter the life they&rsquo;d built for
themselves. And because he himself could not resolve the contradiction of his
willingness to thrive at Babel even as it became clearer, day by day, how
obviously unjust were the foundations of its fortunes. The only way he could
justify his happiness here, to keep dancing on the edges of the two worlds, was
to continue awaiting Griffin&rsquo;s correspondence at night &ndash; a hidden silent
rebellion whose main purpose was to assuage his guilt over the fact that all
this gold and glitter had to come at a cost. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Professor Lovell&rsquo;s promised future of progress and enlightenment seemed only to
have wrought poverty and suffering; the new jobs he thought the displaced
workers should take up never materialized. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>There were rumors of a grand dinner to be put on for Oxford&rsquo;s poor and homeless,
but the city authorities argued that the richness of roast beef and plum pudding
would put the poor in such a state of excitement that they would lose their
ability to properly enjoy the illumination. So the poor went hungry that night,
but at least the lights were lovely. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Oh, the Qing Emperor doesn&rsquo;t care about <em>vices</em>. He&rsquo;s stingy about his
silver, that&rsquo;s all. But trade only works when there&rsquo;s give and take, and
currently we&rsquo;re sitting at a deficit. There&rsquo;s nothing we have that those
Chinamen want, apparently, except opium. They can&rsquo;t get enough of the stuff.
They&rsquo;ll pay anything for it. And if I had my way, every man, woman, and child in
this country would be puffing opium smoke until they couldn&rsquo;t think straight.
<span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Robin saw a great spider&rsquo;s web in his mind then. Cotton from India to Britain,
opium from India to China, silver becoming tea and porcelain in China, and
everything flowing back to Britain. It sounded so abstract &ndash; just categories of
use, exchange, and value &ndash; until it wasn&rsquo;t; until you realized the web you
lived in and the exploitations your lifestyle demanded, until you saw looming
above it all the spectre of colonial labor and colonial pain. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>What &lsquo;free trade&rsquo; really meant was British imperial dominance, for what was free
about a trade that relied on a massive build-up of naval power to secure
maritime access? When mere trading companies could wage war, assess taxes, and
administer civil and criminal justice? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Always this, the argument from bondage, as if his loyalties were shackled by
privilege he had not asked for and did not choose to receive. Did he owe Oxford
his life, just because he had drunk champagne within its cloisters? Did he owe
Babel his loyalty because he once believed its lies? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>You want to do the right thing. You always do. But you think the right thing is
martyrdom. You think if you suffer enough for whatever sins you&rsquo;ve committed,
then you&rsquo;re absolved. [&mldr;] You hanging from the gallows fixes nothing. The
world&rsquo;s still broken. A war&rsquo;s still coming. The only way to properly make amends
is to stop it, which you don&rsquo;t want to do, because really what this is about is
your being afraid. [&mldr;] But all sacrifice does is make you feel better. It
doesn&rsquo;t help the rest of us, so it&rsquo;s an ultimately meaningless gesture. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Most of the British don&rsquo;t understand there&rsquo;s a fight to be had at all. For them,
this war is something imaginary &ndash; something that could only benefit them,
something they don&rsquo;t have to look at or worry over. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span><span class=tag-ref><a href=/tags/societal-apathy>#societal-apathy</a></span></p><p>You&rsquo;ll want to avoid rhetoric about anticolonialism and respecting national
sovereignty. Use terms like <em>scandal</em>, <em>collusion</em>,
<em>corruption</em>, <em>lack of transparency</em>, and whatnot. Cast things in
terms that the average Londoner will get worked up about, and don&rsquo;t make it an
issue of race. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>If we are to turn the tides of history, we need some of those men &ndash; the same
men who find no issue in selling me and my kind at auction &ndash; to become our
allies. We need to convince them that a British expansion, founded on pyramids
of silver, is not in their own best interest. Because their own interest is the
only logic they&rsquo;ll listen to. Not justice, not human dignity, not the liberal
freedoms they so profess to value. Profit. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Next to them, tomes by Plato and Locke and Montesquieu waited to be read,
discussed, gesticulated about; theoretical rights like freedom and liberty would
be debated between those who already enjoyed them, stale concepts that, upon
their readers' graduation ceremonies, would promptly be forgotten. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t seem to crack the code, no matter how she tried, because every time
she asked, the response was always <em>Isn&rsquo;t it obvious, Letty? Don&rsquo;t you
see?</em> No, she <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> see. She found their principles absurd, the
height of foolishness. She thought the Empire inevitable. The future immutable.
And resistance pointless. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>All of them had fought tooth and nail to win a seat in a classroom at Oxford.
[&mldr;] So why wasn&rsquo;t that enough? They&rsquo;d beaten the system. Why in God&rsquo;s name did
they want so badly to break it as well? Why bite the hand that fed you? Why
throw it all away? <em>But there are larger things at stake. It&rsquo;s a matter of
global injustice, Letty. The plunder of the rest of the world.</em> She tried
again to put aside her prejudices, to keep an open mind, to learn what bothered
them so. Time and time again she found her ethics questioned, and she reiterated
her positions, as if proving she was not indeed a bad person. Of course she did
not support this war. Of course she was against all kinds of prejudice and
exploitation. Of course she sided with the abolitionists. Of course she could
support lobbying for change, as long as it was peaceful, respectable, civilized.
But then they were talking about blackmail. [&mldr;] This was no noble fight, only
a shared delusion. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>It was why Griffin and Anthony had been so confident in their struggle, why they
were convinced the colonies could take on the Empire. Empire needed extraction.
Violence shocked the system, because the system could not cannibalize itself and
survive. The hands of the Empire were tied, because it could not raze that from
which it profited. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Strikers in the country never won broad public support, for the public merely
wanted all the conveniences of modern life without the guilt of knowing how
those conveniences were procured. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span><span class=tag-ref><a href=/tags/societal-apathy>#societal-apathy</a></span></p><p>And the grand accomplishment of the imperial project was to take only a little
from so many places; to fragment and distribute the suffering so that at no
point did it ever become too much for the entire community to bear. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>VICTOIRE. I&rsquo;m not being <em>squeamish</em>; I&rsquo;m being prudent. It&rsquo;s too fast,
Robin. It&rsquo;s too much all at once. You need to let the debates settle. You need
to let public opinion turn against the war &ndash;<br>ROBIN. It&rsquo;s not enough. They
won&rsquo;t reason themselves into justice now when they never have before. Fear&rsquo;s the
only thing that works. This is just <em>tactics</em> &ndash;<br>VICTOIRE. This is
not coming from tactics. It&rsquo;s coming from grief.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>PROFESSOR CHAKRAVARTI. You are the proximate cause. You can make it stop.<br>ROBIN. But that&rsquo;s precisely the devil&rsquo;s trick. This is how colonialism works. It
convinces us that the fallout from resistance is entirely our fault, that the
immoral choice is resistance itself rather than the circumstances that demanded
it.<br><span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>We have to die to get their pity. We have to die for them to find us noble. Our
deaths are thus great acts of rebellion, a wretched lament that highlights their
inhumanity. Our deaths become their battle cry. But I don&rsquo;t want to die, Robin.
I don&rsquo;t want to die. I don&rsquo;t want to be their Imoinda, their Oroonoko. I don&rsquo;t
want to be their tragic, lovely lacquer figure. I want to live. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>She has no illusions about what she will encounter. She knows she will face
immeasurable cruelty. She knows her greatest obstacle will be cold indifference,
born of a bone-deep investment in an economic system that privileges some and
crushes others. [&mldr;] Victory is not assured. Victory may be in the portents,
but it must be urged there by violence, by suffering, by martyrs, by blood.
Victory is wrought by ingenuity, persistence, and sacrifice. Victory is a game
of inches, of historical contingencies where everything goes right because they
have made it go right. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><h2 id=belonging>Belonging</h2><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Collects impressions from <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span>on being an outsider in a place
that you&rsquo;re supposed to belong. Resonates with my experiences at Princeton; I
don&rsquo;t think I was ever quite at home despite how much I wanted to.</p></div></div><p>Whenever the English see me, they try to determine what kind of story they know
me from. Either I&rsquo;m a dirty thieving lascar, or I&rsquo;m a servant in some nabob&rsquo;s
house. And I realized in Yorkshire that it&rsquo;s easier if they think I&rsquo;m a Mughal
prince. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>There was no question about what had happened. They were both shaken by the
sudden realization that they did not belong in this place, that despite their
association with the Translation Institute and despite their gowns and
pretensions, their bodies were not safe on the streets. They were men at Oxford;
they were not Oxford men. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>One thing united them all &ndash; without Babel, they had nowhere in this country to
go. They&rsquo;d been chosen for privileges they couldn&rsquo;t have ever imagined, funded
by powerful and wealthy men whose motives they did not fully understand, and
they were acutely aware these could be lost at any moment. That precariousness
made them simultaneously bold and terrified. They had the keys to the kingdom;
they did not want to give them back. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He wanted Pendennis&rsquo;s life, not so much for the material pleasures &ndash; the wine,
the cigars, the clothes, the dinners &ndash; but for what it represented: the
assurance that one would always be welcome in England. If he could only attain
Pendennis&rsquo;s fluency, or at least an imitation of it, then he, too, would blend
into the tapestry of this idyllic campus life. And he would no longer be the
foreigner, second-guessing his pronunciation at every turn, but a native whose
belonging could not possibly be questioned or revoked. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Her distress belied a deeper terror, a terror which Robin felt as well, which
was that Anthony had been expendable. That they were all expendable. That this
tower &ndash; this place where they had for the first time found belonging &ndash;
treasured and loved them when they were alive and useful but didn&rsquo;t, in fact,
care about them at all. That they were, in the end, only vessels for the
languages they spoke. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He grew so good at this that he almost began to lose himself in the artifice. A
dangerous trap indeed, for a player to believe his own stories, to be blinded by
the applause. He could envision himself as a postgraduate fellow, dripping with
distinctions and awards. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Victoire only had Letty, who professed to always to love her, to absolutely
adore her, but who failed to hear anything she was saying if it didn&rsquo;t comport
with how she already saw the world. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>That dream had always been founded on a lie. None of them had ever stood a
chance of truly belonging here, for Oxford wanted only one kind of scholar, the
kind born and bred to cycle through posts of power it had created for itself.
Everyone else it chewed up and discarded. These towering edifices were built
from the coin of the sale of slaves, and the silver that kept them running came
blood-stained from the mines of Potosí. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><h2 id=leaving>Leaving</h2><p>The word <em>loss</em> was inadequate. Loss just meant a lack, meant something
was missing, but it did not encompass the totality of this severance, this
terrifying un-anchoring from all that he&rsquo;d ever known. He watched the ocean for
a long time, indifferent to the wind, staring until even his imagined vision of
the shore faded away. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He tried very hard to live exclusively in English. When thoughts popped up in
Chinese, he quashed them. He quashed his memories too. His life in Canton &ndash; his
mother, his grandparents, a decade of running about the docks &ndash; it all proved
surprisingly easy to shed, perhaps because this passage was so jarring, the
break so complete. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Languages are easier to forget than you imagine. Once you stop living in the
world of Chinese, you stop thinking in Chinese. I want you to <em>live</em> in
English, this is true. But I still need you to practice your Chinese. Words and
phrases you think are carved into your bones can disappear in no time. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>Need to read Kiswahili books lest it atrophies!</p></div></div><p>They blinked at each other. Robin felt that surely there were other words that
should be said, words to mark this occasion &ndash; his growing up, leaving home, his
entering university &ndash; as momentous. But he couldn&rsquo;t imagine what they might be,
and apparently neither could Professor Lovell. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>For the first time since he&rsquo;d arrived at Oxford, it struck him that he was to
make a life here. He imagined it stretched out before him: the gradual
accumulation of books and trinkets in those spare bookshelves [&mldr;] <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I recall feeling this in Butler College on landing in the US. There was a sense
of finality that I hadn&rsquo;t felt until I got my student ID and lay inside my dorm
room. &ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; I thought, afraid but hopeful.</p></div></div><p>Canton had always been a shifting, dynamic city, sucking in what the sea
delivered and digesting it all into its own peculiar hybridity. How could he
ever assume it might remain rooted in the past? <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><h2 id=characterization>Characterization</h2><p>The labourer gawked at him. A thousand emotions worked through that weathered
face &ndash; indignation, frustration, and finally, resignation. Robin had been
afraid the labourer might argue, might fight, but quickly it became clear that
for this man, such treatment was nothing new. This had happened before. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He made a decision then. He would never question Professor Lovell, never probe
at the empty space where the truth belonged. As long as Professor Lovell did not
accept him as a son, Robin would not attempt to claim him as a father. A lie was
not a lie if it was never uttered; questions that were never asked did not need
answers. They would both remain perfectly content to linger in the liminal,
endless space between truth and denial. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>I see now that I was wrong. Laziness and deceit are common traits among your
kind. This is why China remains an indolent and backwards country while her
neighbors hurtle towards progress. You are, by nature, foolish, weak-minded, and
disinclined to hard work. You must resist these traits, Robin. You must learn to
overcome the pollution of your blood. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>For a professor at Oxford, Lovell is surprisingly backward in his perception of
other races.</p></div></div><p>Some other child suited to better, kinder treatment might have realized that
such nonchalance on the part of adults like Mrs Piper, Mr Felton, and Mr Chester
to a badly bruised eleven-year-old was frightfully wrong. But Robin was so
grateful for this return to equilibrium that he couldn&rsquo;t find it in himself to
even resent what had happened. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>Even his course readings became more exciting when he began seeing them as
source material for cutting observations, complaining or humorous, to be shared
later with the group. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><div class=comment-holder><div class=comment><p>I wish I did more of this in college during my formative years. Constructing
jokes like those in <span class=citation-ref><a href=#TheJeffDeanFacts></a></span>would have made the grinds
more enjoyable. My favorite is: <em>Jeff Dean puts his pants on one leg at a
time, but if he had more than two legs, you would see that his approach is
actually \(\mathcal{O}(log (n))\).</em></p></div></div><p>&ldquo;I write,&rdquo; Pendennis said with very deliberate indifference, the way people who
are very conceited throw out morsels of information they hope become objects of
fascination. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>They became what they&rsquo;d aspired to be since their first year &ndash; aloof,
brilliant, and fatigued to the bone. They were miserable. They slept and ate too
little, read too much, and fell completely out of touch with matters outside
Oxford or Babel. They ignored the life of the world; they lived only in the life
of the mind. They adored it. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>They were all presently suffering the peculiar madness of the very scared and
very determined, the madness that made academia feel as dangerous as the
battlefield. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He had become so good at holding two truths in his head at once. That he was an
Englishman and not. That Professor Lovell was his father and not. That the
Chinese were a stupid, backwards people, and that he was also one of them. That
he hated Babel, and wanted to live forever in its embrace. He had danced for
years at the razor&rsquo;s edge of these truths, had remained there as a means of
survival, a way to cope, unable to accept either side fully because an
unflinching examination of the truth was so frightening that the contradictions
threatened to break him. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>It took him a moment to realize what it was that grated on him, and when he did,
it would bother him constantly, now and thereafter; it would seem a great
paradox, the fact that after everything they had told Letty, all the pain they
shared, she was the one who needed comfort. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><h2 id=world-building>World Building</h2><p>No one exclaimed in surprise when he kicked the front door &ndash; locked, because
plague thieves were stripping the houses in the neighborhood bare, and though
there was little of value in their home, the boy and his mother had wanted a few
hours of peace before the sickness took them too. The boy heard all the
commotion from upstairs, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to care. By then he only
wanted to die. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><p>He learned that London in 1830 was a city that could not decide what it wanted
to be. The Silver City was the largest financial centre of the world, the
leading edge of industry and technology. But its profits were not shared
equally. London was as much a city of plays at Covent Garden and balls in
Mayfair as it was a city of teeming slums around St Giles. <span class=citation-ref><a href=#Babel2022></a></span></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><div class=citation citation-icon-class="fas fa-fw fa-globe" cited-by-count is-main><cite id=EspousedVsEnacted>espoused values vs enacted values - Google Search<i>.</i></cite>
