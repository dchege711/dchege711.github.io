communicators.</p><p>Pretentious diction to make the banal appear profound, the biased seem
scientifically impartial and sordid events masquerade as dignified.</p><p>Some words are not meant to point to any discoverable object, e.g. praising a
country as democratic.</p><p>We need to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way round. The
first line of defense is not to define your problematic terms, but to see
whether you can think without using those terms at all.</p><p>If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy.
You can&rsquo;t speak of any dialects, and when you make a stupid remark, its
stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.</p><p>Passive voice obscures reality. &ldquo;The subjects were administered Progenitorivox&rdquo;.
In reality, the scientist is there, and the subjects are students and the
Progenitorivox was handed over with instructions.</p><p>If a metaphor doesn&rsquo;t evoke an image, don&rsquo;t use it. Tired/Dying metapahors are a
lazy man&rsquo;s game. A word itself can have the destructive force of clich√©; a word
itself can carry the poison of a cached thought.</p><p>Meaning does not excuse impact. Be consciously aware of the experiences that
words create. &ldquo;AI should be developed through democratic processes&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be
excused from signaling the audience to applaud. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s as vague as
they come.</p><p>Political language has come to consist mainly of euphemism, question-begging and
sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air,
inhabitants driven from the countryside, the cattle are machine-gunned, the huts
are set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION. See also
