  Put yourself into different roles, e.g. the person just looking for samples, the person who wants to read up on every nook and crany, the person who has no technical background etc.</description>

Pretentious diction to make the banal appear profound, the biased seem scientifically impartial and sordid events masquerade as dignified.</description>
