<h2 id="placement-of-the-subject-and-thesis">Placement of the Subject and Thesis</h2>
<p>Subject can be in the first sentence or at the other extreme, in the first sentence after preliminary material.</p>
<p>Thesis can be in the climax (middle), or in the conclusion (if it&rsquo;s drawn from the middle part).</p>
<p>For who-what-when-where-why-how essays (scientific reports and news), the thesis should be at the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-of-content">Consistency of Content</h2>
<p>Reference the subject at least in every topic sentence of your paragraphs.</p>
<p>Ensure that every paragraph relates directly/indirectly to your thesis.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t digress from your subject and thesis except for rhetorical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="beautiful-writing-the-iliad-kenneth-rexroth">Beautiful Writing: The Iliad, Kenneth Rexroth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Violence is not approved of in itself by the Greeks, but all the values they most admire - the nobility, pride and power, glamour and strength of barbaric chieftains - flourish only in the context of violence and must be fed continuously by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Form theses of instances when you were forced to look at an experience from a new angle, e.g. a childhood illness, the first stirrings of romance, a youthful criminal adventure, etc.</p>
