The combinations of the possible differences at multiple loci form a DNA profile that can be used to tie suspects to a crime scene. []

                        On Coming Up With New Theories A crackpot publicizes a theory that feels right. A theorist goes further to try and disprove a theory that feels right, before publishing it. []
There is still value in an earnest well-thought out theory, even if it turns out wrong, e.g. saving others the trouble. Juniors spend far more time making sure they know everything, while seniors release more half-baked ideas - yet the senior&rsquo;s half-baked ideas will probably be more widely read....

                        Should Platforms Be Neutral? Facebook banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism, because the two concepts cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Furthermore, people that search for related terms will have &ldquo;Life After Hate&rdquo; suggested to them. []
Part of me is uncomfortable. Sure, Facebook is trying to do the right thing here. What if Facebook was replaced by some tyrannical government that censors opposition?...

                        Reading to Know Choose your content. Some books [and articles] are not worth the effort. Sometimes you just don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;ll remember what you&rsquo;ve read. []
But even if you don&rsquo;t remember the specifics, the effect on your model of the world persists. As your mental model evolves, re-reading books is beneficial because the material compiles differently. []
When reading, annotate connections from previous knowledge, unanswered questions and unjustified assumptions....

                        Mergeable Replicated Data Types [] On a distributed system, each replica should [eventually] converge to the same state. Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) can accept updates and achieve consistent without remote synchronization.
The Need for Commutativity Say we have a queue \( 1 \to 2 \). Suppose two replicas, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), independently call pop(). Each replica will have \(2\) on their queue.
However, on receiving an update that the other replica popped, each replica will call pop() to be consistent, thereby deleting \(2\)....

Feb 14, 2020.  Attracting the Masses Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder) injected $50m into the Signal Foundation, allowing them to grow from 3 to 50 full-timers.
You&rsquo;d think that at Signal&rsquo;s dominance, getting $$$ shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. But VCs expect a multiple return and Signal doesn&rsquo;t look like it will monetize soon....

                        The Submarine.  Paul Graham. http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html . Apr 1, 2005.  Many people rely on social proof to form opinions; therein lies the power of PR.
PR firms are not dishonest for they need good reputation with news outlets. But PR firms serve overworked reporters with selective truths.
The firms feed the same story to different publications at once. Readers see similar stories in multiple places and assume a new trend has come....

Doctors tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know enough about modern medicine to know its limits. They go gently into that good night - no heroics; no CPR.
Sometimes, a family really means &lsquo;do everything&rsquo;, but often they mean &lsquo;do everything that’s reasonable.&rsquo; But they may not know what’s reasonable.
People have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can accomplish....

LTCM were exploiting market inefficiencies. Other people learned of the tricks. LTCM didn&rsquo;t lose hope. They borrowed more and more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins.
And their math probably said the leverage was okay....

Growth mindset: people who believe effort - and not ability - determines success are more resilient, skillful, hard-working, perseverant in the face of failure.

If there was an idea that could &lsquo;fix&rsquo; democracy, it would have been thought-up already. If you don&rsquo;t see your idea out there, it’s because it didn’t work the hundreds of other times someone tried it.
Let’s tell representatives what their constituents think. Then they HAVE to vote with us!
 They don’t necessarily want to know what their constituents are thinking....

Choosing a bullshit minimizing path is error-prone. Your priorities change over time. Periodically evaluate where you are. It helps to have measurable aspects of your life.

That is, the ensemble averages equal the corresponding time averages with probability one.
