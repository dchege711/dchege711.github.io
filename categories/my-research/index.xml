      <description>Motivation In 08. A New Walking Shoe: Modern Portfolio Theory , Malkiel introduced me to Modern Portfolio Theory, a technique for reducing portfolio risk, despite risky investments. It made me wonder how similar principles are applied in agriculture. This page is the result of that investigation.
~16% of Kenya&amp;rsquo;s land is sufficiently fertile and has good rainfall. In 2006, ~75% of working Kenyans are farmers (compared to 80% in 1980). (en.</description>

      <description>Index Funds and 401(k) Accounts  I assume the return is ~5% There are 4 types of retirement accounts, each with tradeoffs (en.wikipedia.org)    401(k), Roth 401(k), Traditional IRA and Roth IRA   The return of lazy portfolios (set and forget) is ~6% (compounded) over 15 years as of 2018 (finpage.blog)    Notes from /r/investing&amp;rsquo;s FAQ (reddit.com)    The FAQ emphasizes reading books  I don&amp;rsquo;t see the urgency.</description>

      <title>Investing in Capital Markets</title>

      <description>The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)  
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s why quant funds are not a thing in Kenya.</description>

      <description>Investing through Groups (Chamas)  www.kaig.org  has developed a Chama Handbook to boost accountability and profitability.
But chamas have a higher chance of being guided by friendships than profitability. For instance, how do I go about picking a chama? It&amp;rsquo;s most likely a referral from a friend who&amp;rsquo;s already in a chama.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s All About Real Estate I admit that I&amp;rsquo;m biased towards the conclusion that the Kenyan real estate market is in a bubble. My &amp;lsquo;evidence&amp;rsquo; is the notion that people are buying land, holding onto it as it appreciates, then selling it off. Reminds me of Malkiel&amp;rsquo;s discussion on how the crowd can get uber-speculative, abandoning reality itself 
Questions to Dig Into  Who is in real estate? Who are the main players?</description>

      <description>etfdb.com has ETFs tracking regions. Surprised that Kenya isn&amp;rsquo;t on it  . And they&amp;rsquo;re all losing money - best (over 5 years) is SA at -14.59%, Nigeria is at -64%  .   Why all the PR on Africa being the next big investment scene?  Of course, Kenya&amp;rsquo;s the premier investment destination (invest.go.ke)     Am I reading this right?? SOXL (semiconductors) ETF has &amp;gt;700% return over 5 years etfdb.</description>
