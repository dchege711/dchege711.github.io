      <description>Motivation In 08. A New Walking Shoe: Modern Portfolio Theory, Malkiel introduced me to Modern Portfolio Theory, a technique for reducing portfolio risk, despite risky investments. It made me wonder how similar principles are applied in agriculture. This page is the result of that investigation.
~16% of Kenya&#39;s land is sufficiently fertile and has good rainfall. In 2006, ~75% of working Kenyans are farmers (compared to 80% in 1980). (en.wikipedia.org)</description>

      <description>Index Funds and 401(k) Accounts  I assume the return is ~5% There are 4 types of retirement accounts, each with tradeoffs (en.wikipedia.org)  401(k), Roth 401(k), Traditional IRA and Roth IRA   The return of lazy portfolios (set and forget) is ~6% (compounded) over 15 years as of 2018 (finpage.blog)  Notes from /r/investing&#39;s FAQ (reddit.com)  The FAQ emphasizes reading books  I don&#39;t see the urgency. It&#39;s not as if I&#39;ll be picking my own stocks&amp;hellip; Maybe it&#39;s for me to know when to call bullshit.</description>

      <description>The Stock Market To trade in the NSE, open a CDS account with a CDA (some commercial banks, stockbrokers, investment banks).
In 2006, an Automatic Trading System was introduced so that orders are matched automatically and executed by stockbrokers on a first-come first-served basis. Govt bonds have also been added to the ATS. Securities lending, short-selling and same day turnaround trades are not yet permitted. (kestrelcapital.com)
I guess that&#39;s why quant funds are not a thing in Kenya.</description>

      <description>Investing through Groups (Chamas) www.kaig.org has developed a Chama Handbook to boost accountability and profitability.
But chamas have a higher chance of being guided by friendships than profitability. For instance, how do I go about picking a chama? It&#39;s most likely a referral from a friend who&#39;s already in a chama.

      <description> etfdb.com has ETFs tracking regions. Surprised that Kenya isn&#39;t on it. And they&#39;re all losing money - best (over 5 years) is SA at -14.59%, Nigeria is at -64%.   Why all the PR on Africa being the next big investment scene?  Of course, Kenya&#39;s the premier investment destination (invest.go.ke)   Am I reading this right?? SOXL (semiconductors) ETF has &amp;gt;700% return over 5 years etfdb.com    </description>
